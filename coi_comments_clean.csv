"This is an area housing many existing and upcoming technology workers living around CHandler + Gilbert. We have common needs like Jobs, Work permits, common hours of work etcn"
"This community consists of many small to medium sized towns in eastern Arizona that have historically been dependent on the ranching and mining industries, featuring large patches of open range cattle land and active mineral and copper mines throughout that are less common in other areas of Arizona. Counties included in this community are Graham, Greenlee, and parts of Gila, Navajo, and Apache. Towns included in this are Safford, Clifton, Globe, Miami, Superior, Holbrok, Winslow, Springerville, Snowflake, Show Low, Pinetop-Lakeside, etc. Geographically, this region is mountainous featuring the most extreme portions of the Mogollan rim.n"
"This community consists of areas that are heavily influenced by the presence of military bases and other defense and intelligence related operations. This includes Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Fort Huachuca in Sierra Vista, Raytheon industries in Tucson and cybersecurity operations in Sierra Vista. This community includes parts of Pima and Cochise counties, and it includes east Tucson as well as the Sierra Vista metro.n"
"This community consists of a series of cities and towns in western Pinal counties that are similar in their connection to the bustling I-10 corridor between the Tucson and Phoenix metropolitan areas. The cities and towns included are Casa Grande, Eloy, Coolidge, Florence, and Maricopa.nDespite their proximity to the Phoenix and Tucson metro areas, I believe it is important for the towns in the I-10 corridor to be separated by these two cities with regards to their placement in legislative and congressional districts. This area probably has approximately the correct population for a legislative district. In a state that is so dominated by urban and suburban areas, I think it is important that in congressional redistricting the I-10 corridor gets grouped with other rural areas rather than the northern Tucson suburbs (Oro Valley and Marana) or the southeastern Phoenix suburbs (Chandler, Gilbert, Queen Creek, San Tan Valley, Apache Junction), since throwing the I-10 corridor into a district with these communities would dilute rural voting power even further than it already is in this very urban state."
"Vistancia is in Peoria and has several communities within the borders.  Blackstone, Vistancia Village, and Trilogy are the main communities.  Currently, the communities are split between AZ04 and AZ08. Mostly all services, churches, shopping, and schools are located in AZ08.nI believe the Community would be best served if it all were in AZ08.  The residents mostly shop, work, go to school, etc. in AZ08  so it only makes sense to include all of the community in the one district."
"Vistancia is a master planned community which means inherently all of the residents have a multitude of things very much in common from income, to housing, employment and community needs.  As a board member I learned this community is split into two different districts which everyone agrees does not make sense.  This means the same master planned community has two different individuals fighting for our need which never happens.  Each one has a different agenda.  This is a newer community.  I see changing the lines to bring our entire community into one district more of a house keeping issue.  It just makes sense from a managing issue as well as to our residents. n"
"Arizona IRC:

Because we cannot attend the July 23rd  meeting in Florence tomorrow night, my wife and I would like to thank you for scheduling the public meetings and assure you we will attend future meetings.

We live in Pinal County at SaddleBrooke Ranch and do most of our shopping in Catalina and Oro Valley.  We hope you will consider our request to balance voting districts for Congressional and Legislative Districts to help people vote for geographic areas they frequent.  We also hope you will seriously consider making the voting districts contain approximately the same number of citizens so that none have leverage over others.

We use Oro Valley Hospital and the greater Tucson area for medical services.  We use restaurants, shopping and leisure services in the Oracle, Oro Valley and Catalina areas as same services in Florence, Casa Grande and San Tan are too far to drive.

Honorable Ladies and Gentlemen of the IRC:

Thank you for leading Arizona forward in the effort to create fair and proper voting districts to serve our State and Nation!

We use Oro Valley Hospital and the greater Tucson area for medical services.  We use restaurants, shopping and leisure services in the Oracle, Oro Valley and Catalina areas as same services in Florence, Casa Grande and San Tan are too far to drive.  So please let our voting districts be akin to where we focus our attention.

Our community interest is southern Pinal County and we hope you look at factors like access to I-10, airports and medical and emergency services that relate to balanced voting districts of equal size.  Our Nations strength comes from honest and fair elections.  We are depending on you all to do a proper job!

"West Phoenix is a community of interest as a low to moderate income community mainly made up of similar housing options, income levels, two extra large Catholic churches, a variety of smaller churches, a large part of the Maryvale-Estrella Police Precinct, four strategically placed community centers, the Desert Sky Shopping Mall, the Maryvale Baseball Park (Milwaukee Brewers), grid bus routes, a circulator bus system, a village planning committee; significant parts of four public school districts; several charter schools; long distance commuting for employment; a shortage of short commute employment and a master planned system of parks.  English is the prevalent language, but Spanish also is spoken by a large number of people.nAs a community activist in west Phoenix for 19 years, I have found that the people yearn to speak for themselves.  They would prefer to have their elected officials accountable to them rather than the present system of dividing west Phoenix into three legislative districts each with a middle class majority by reaching beyond the natural boundaries of west Phoenix.  The result is a middle class approach to west Phoenix issues, which are far off course.  I believe west Phoenix residents would prefer one or two legislative districts with low income majorities so that elected officials are accountable to the local residents."
This area is the most diverse portion of district 8 and should be included in a more diverse district to allow for better representation.n

"Southeastern Arizona Tri-County Area. Graham, Greenlee, and Cochise Counties, along with the San Carlos Apache Reservation constitute a wider rural community. Our students play each other in sports, we go to one another's community meetings, we correlate strategic plans, and join together in Grant applications. It would be great to see our Congressional District more closely resemble our Arizona Legislative District. Congressional District 1 is too big. It is bigger than some states. Tom O'Halleran has done an great job visiting us. Someday Tom won't be there, and Graham and Greenlee Counties may be disenfranchsed. I'd like to see us join our neighbors in Cochise County in our Congressional District.n"
"For the last census our community (a Robson 55+ Property called Saddlebrooke Ranch had less than 50 homes.  At this census we now have 1200 homes and nearly 2000 residents and by the next census it will be growing to 8000 residents.  Currently we are not in the same legislative district as other 55+ and over communities very close to us: Saddlebrooke, Oro Valley or Sun  City.  All of our restaurants, other commerce, hospital, medical, dental professionals and banks are in Oro Valley and Catalina area.  We support those communities near by but not in other LD8 communities like Florence.  Florence is 35 miles away on a rural road from Saddlebrooke Ranch.

We are currently represented by the same legislators as Florence, San Tan Valley, San Manuel, Winkelman and other rural communities that do not share the same interests and needs that we do.

"We are rural, mostly historic mining towns with depressed economies to a greater or lesser degree with many residents below the poverty line. Most of our towns are still part of the extractives industries though we are working towards economic diversification for sustainability, well-being, and quality of life. Large multi-national extractive corporations are major employers and influencers. Our community generates a significant amount of tax revenue for Arizona, most of which leaves our community. We have some of the most beautiful parts of Arizona, we work to conserve our outdoor resources and promote recreation for residents and visitors. We are proud of our history and multi-ethnic culture and have many festivals and celebrations in the area. English & Spanish are predominant languages.nWe wish to be grouped together as we have common heritage and problems as rural communities. Eastern Pinal County, a large part of the Copper Corridor, often finds itself in competition for resources with communities like San Tan that see themselves are semi-urban and part of the Phoenix Metropolitan area. Our interests do not coincide. We need fiber optic broadband for high-speed internet to attract new businesses and allow families to prosper economically and educationally. "
"We are Republican with Republican Values, families who enjoy their life and wish to live without fear which the Democrats foster :(

"I live in Casa Grande, split between LD 8 & 11. I am advocating for the City to be contained in one district. The city is situated in a rural area. Here, you can find locally owned businesses that are characteristic of the entrepreneurial spirit of our city. Manufacturing and agriculture are major industries and these industries are bringing growth to the community. People from across the city are employed in these industries.  Community services are accessed by the entire community not just certain groups in certain areas. These services include the Parks and Recreation Department, the Police Department, the Fire Department, etc. There is only one elementary school district in the city. I do not feel the schools in my community should be split between districts when one board represents them. The highest concentration of the pop. is white with minority groups spread throughout the city.nBy cracking the community as it is now, it has essentially diminished the power of certain communities within the city to advocate for themselves and their shared interests, which makes representation less responsive to the actual community and its interests.

Our northern boundary is just past Val Vista Rd, our western border lies along Fuqua Rd, our southern boundary is along Battaglia and our Eastern boundary runs along Eleven Mile Corner."
"The City of Tempe is my community and is connected by neighborhoods .  Residents are connected to their neighborhood and, as a city, by neighborhoods collectively. Organization and voice is often rallied at the neighborhood level. 

Local city governance is  often impacted by legislation at the state level. It is important to keep Tempe together to have a voice around our common issues.

Additionally, the city has a system of administration  that works  to improve housing, childcare, environment, transportation etc. Our legislative voice and power, I believe is city centric.

School Districts that overlay the city are important, especially when it comes to childcare and social services; if at all possible keeping those whole will further strengthen our voice. Student housing and other relational aspects to ASU should be kept together.

nI understand that a legislative district is approximately 240,000 which would work in terms of the size of Tempe.

Although there are some common social economic factors with the City of Mesa, I think Mesa is quite different than Tempe; please keep this in mind when slicing and dicing populations.

In addition to VRA, competitiveness is a high priority for our state, nation and should not be dismissed. These last years we have seen extreme polarization; the opportunity that competitiveness gives us should not be ignored or reduced in any decision criteria. Competitiveness  along with the elevation of VRA will strengthen us.

For geographic neighborhoods, the city of Tempe has maps. I attempted to draw a map for the city of Tempe, please disregard my map and refer to the actual City of Tempe geography; my map would be the city of Tempe.

Map is not easy to use on a desk top computer with a mouse."

Good restaurants and local celebrations and events.n"
"Our community is changing. As home prices continue to rise in the PHX metro area, homeowners are drifting further from the city. The pandemic and virtual working has also created a freedom from the city, and we have seen the sprawl as a result. We currently have close to 100,000 (or more based on last census) in our little community of San Tan Valley. Our town is unincorporated and is not dealing well with planned development to support the sprawl. There is increased pressure for services, without the development or tax base to support the necessary services. Schools are becoming crowded but underfunded, and unable to pass a referendum to relieve the overcrowding.  We are starting the school year 20 bus drivers short. Our current funding does not allow us to be competitive with surrounding districts who have a richer tax base and more business development. The diversity of our community can be seen in our school demographics:  in FUSD currently about 40% of our students are Hispanic.nLD8 is a mammoth district. It has historically been rural, but the block that is San Tan Valley is changing. Currently STV has more in common with Queen Creek than with many of the rural towns in the district. That being said, whatever district lines that are drawn should be sure to include all of the school district (FUSD) in one district. We have a shortage of housing options in our community. There are zero multifamily housing units for rent. Many families cannot afford the $2000 a month home rental, which is the going rate right now. We are seeing more ""room rentals"" with strangers right now, which isn't a great option. We don't have fire or emergency services unless we pay separately for them (Rural Metro Fire). Water issues are a concern to those paying attention. Casa Grande wants to be in one district - they should move out of 8 to 11 and Queen Creek should be in 8. Mountain communities like Globe have little in common with our community."
"I live at 3701 E Thames Cir, San Tan Valley, AZ, 85140. My community of interest is San Tan Valley, Pinal County.  My community of interest is currently split between multiple districts, which is not compact and does not represent our community well. I am currently in LD16 and should not be added to LD4 or 8. San Tan Valley has grown nearly 19% since the 2010 census and I believe it continues to grow, despite the pandemic. Although San Tan Valley has, and continues to grow, the people who live here share common interests and values. They go to the same grocery stores, churches and community events and we support the local agriculture and ranch community such as Rhibafarm Organic Farm and The Pork Shop traditional butcher. I respectfully ask that you keep my community of interest together and not divide us up.nI am retired from a career as a civilian with the U.S. Navy and my husband and I moved to Arizona last October from California to be closer to my family who also live in San Tan Valley. We are settling into life in Arizona and spending time with my daughter, my son and his wife and daughter who all live in San Tan Valley. When we decided to move to Arizona we looked at several areas but appreciated that San Tan Valley had a thriving agricultural and ranching community, not unlike the Central Valley of California or like the mid-west where I grew up. This was one of the reasons my family chose this area of Arizona to move to, because it reminded us of the communities we loved. Please recognize this community of interest by keeping us together and not dividing us up into other communities. Thank you for your consideration."

My community is very much tied around events, activities and shopping in downtown Glendale, Saguaro Ranch Park, downtown Peoria, Glendale Community College, Arrowhead Town Center, the Glendale libraries, and the stadium and arena at Westgate. I regularly support the Peoria Center for the Performing Arts, Spotlight Youth Theater and AZ Broadway Theater. I am very involved with several churches in the area and also Copperwood Elementary and Ironwood High schools as my kids attended those. While I also attend many events across the valley, my neighbors are more inclined to stay within and support our community.nAlthough my community of interest crosses borders, I do believe the legislative districts should not cross city boundaries. That just gets too confusing for people and makes it hard for them to be informed voters. I also believe party affiliation should not be looked at when drawing boundaries. It should be based on population distribution and communities of interest."

"Gold Canyon is primarily made up of subdivisions north of Highway 60. We all share the same zip code: 85118. It is currently divided into two legislative districts (LD), LD16 and 8. 

LD16 contains Apache Junction, a portion of Gold Canyon, East Mesa, and parts of San Tan Valley. LD8 includes a small part of Gila County (Globe/Miami) and the towns along the Copper Corridor, Florence, Coolidge, and Casa Grande.

Gold Canyon shares nothing in common with East Mesa, which is primarily urban and has no historical or cultural ties with the mining and agricultural interest of the communities represented in LD8.nWith our legislative representation split, and having a minority interest in both districts our community is an afterthought. LD8’s focus is on Interstate 10 and the commercial corridor through Casa Grande. LD16, where the majority of interest is Mesa, has mass transit and highway infrastructure in place so attention to the east is not being considered. 

Gold Canyon is a retirement community with a large contingent of seasonal residents, which approximately doubles the population in the winter months, increasing the volume of traffic in the area. There are no major employment centers, so those who work have to commute (using Highway 60) into the Phoenix metropolitan area."

"LD 11 currently goes from the City of Maricopa all the way to Saddlebrook (which is unincorporated)  We believe that while we have some things in common, not enough to justify a competitive district and a community of interest. We would request a much more conjoined district with other cities (incorporated) that share the ssme concerns and challenges. For example Maricopa & Casa Grande should not be split.  That is certainly important when voting in the state Legislature.  We would also like to see a more concentrated area and one that much more consolidated in Pinal County only.  Not spread across 3 counties.  As for CD1 this district takes up 1/3 of the entire state for 1 district!!!! This is CRAZY for this poor congress person. That is bigger than the entire state of Pennsylvania!!  This cannot remain.  We ask that this district be broken up in a more northern and southern district that as lines are redrawn for other CD's that they are not only based in population but also...nin area fairness.  We'd also like to see our area in a much more PInal County centric District!!!  We are one of the fastest growing counties in the state and we will double again in the next 10 years. As much as we legally can let's plan for that growth and assign our congressional representatives to areas that growing in communities of geographical interest as well as moving out of rural designation into urbanizing designation such as our fast growing cities. Thank you."
"Our community is a group of people that love the history of Arizona and the magic of the mountains.  Here we have veterans from different wars.  Also, our small businesses honor our Veterans as well as the retirement community around us.  We are getting more subdivisions of younger people and families starting out but also come to our area to take advantage of our small town without having to be so far away from the big city for work.  Here in this community we take advantage of our small businesses and gather for social activities that include our community. nWe have been in the past considered a compact community and were not divided during the last redistricting.  We would like to stay not divided and a part of the Pinal County Rural demographic.

"My community goes from 19th Avenue to the 17 Freeway from Indian School up to Camelback. We are majority working class and really care about the infrastructure and safety nets of our community. We like well-lit streets, well paved roads, and parks for the kids, families and pets in the neighborhood. We have a wealth of culture--many Latinos, including myself, have made this place home. We also have great small businesses, which are supported and uplifted by our neighbors. We also have community clinics, a local park and the canal that we utilize to improve our health. We do have challenges as well--we are all impacted by air quality and pollution since we are surrounded by the 17 freeway and the freight train that can emit pollutants. We also have some of the highest rates of kids on free/reduced lunch and need to improve vaccination rates. Even with all of this, our community pushes on. I know we can make more improvements as time goes on and as we uplift leaders in my neighborhood.nWe are apart of the wonderful Legislative District 30. People are very active in this district civically and we are in the process of organizing park clean ups around the district. We have found that people like clean streets and we help our neighbors in the process. We take on issues as a community and try to support one another when we can. We are also a district that is forgotten when it comes to support from our city and government--that is why we often organize ourselves to create change."

We keep our roads clean through the Adopt a Road program and voluntarily gather to pick up waste.  Our community has all the emminities needed and we rarely visit the City of Tucson.

"The North Central Phoenix Community is anything but monolithic. We have many different religions. There is no one dominate employer. Although it is largely white non-hispanic, there is at least a modest amount of ethnic diversity; there is certainly religious diversity. To the extent there are community ties, they largely result from the Madison Elementary School District which is the source of great pride and thought to be one of the best in the Phoenix area. Even kids who do not attend Madison public schools often play sports through RAMMS baseball, RAMMS basketball and Madison Football Club soccer. These extracurricular activities bring together families of diverse religious and socioeconomic background and foster a real sense of community. The school district is currently part of LD 28 and it should remain within a single state legislative district.nLD 28 has been an unqualified success in terms of a truly competitive district. A history of close elections has encouraged large amounts of civic involvement in elections and very high voter participation. The competition in LD 28 has also resulted in higher quality candidates and elected representatives who are extremely responsive to their constituents. We need as many similar districts as possible going forward."
"City of Maricopa was a small snow bird/bedroom community for people who work in Phoenix.  It is now growing rapidly and becoming a city where people live and work, many self-employed &/or working from home.  We are multi-cultural.

"The mapping software needs WORK.  My community of interest would be roughly 7th Avenue to 56th Street from Maryland to Osborn.

It encompasses a Native American community near Indian School, older neighborhoods with long-time residents, and Arizona, and some of the most independent minded voters in Arizona.  Please favor compactness ( based on geographic - use of hospitals - use of same police station - same city), competitiveness based on voting that takes into account independents.  Please avoid economic and community factors  that cannot be verified. It is also important to create districts that both honor the VRA and integrate our Native American communities into their local geographic communities when possible.nPlease make the map easier to use.  It doesn't seem to be fully functional.   As for making decisions, I am weary of how the communities of interest seem to be addressed in the consultant's commentary.  There has been much commentary on where I live and work.  These comments are anecdotal.  It isn't the case where most residents work where they live .  Second, my understanding that the economics/work is to be considered a significant issue when it relates to a large group like a military base, a port, an industory or manufacturing sectior or a particular agriculture crop/product.   For example, I'm pretty sure the people that live in the part of South Phoenix in expensive homes shop at the same stores as the people that have been speaking.   Given public health issues, I think compactness  and favoring geographic is better than creating N/S Congressional districts that would not be serviced by the same hospital or public safety officials."

An additional 7% of residents, above 200K, is not considered, as it is an anomaly in this neighborhood and likely corresponds to upward mobility. 

Our So. Scottsdale community is more economically, ethnically and generationally diverse compared to the rest of Scottsdale, and has an infrastructure not typical of the upscale homes, apartments, restaurants, and shopping alternatives north of Osborn Road. Our issues are typical of downtowns that try to equitably revitalize themselves, which we’ve done to a large extent. But we need government aid for lingering social problems. Thus, it’s desirable to keep our urban-friendly legislators, who currently represent our districts. I ask that you keep Legislative District 24 and Congressional District 9 as is."
"The South Tempe and Chandler area is my community of interest. The neighborhoods are very similar. The demographics are very similar. I support businesses in both South Tempe and Chandler. I attend church in South Tempe along with many friends from Chandler. I've resided in South Tempe for 37 years. I receive medical care at Dignity Health/Chandler Regional Hospital and from many other medical providers in Chandler. My employer for over twenty five years had significant business operations in both South Tempe and Chandler. South Tempe and Chandler residents have very similar issues (i.e. Loop 101/Loop 202 freeways,  high technology businesses, ASU Research Park, Intel, property tax rates, etc). South Tempe and Chandler are in the same county supervisory district.n"
"I am a minority in a predominately Hispanic area.  My neighbors speak Spanish and I do not.  Our community is comprised of labor for landscape, construction, trucking, etc.  Our neighborhood is deteriorating with more trash in street and homeless in area.  Hispanic culture generally has more residents in a family home than allowed by State law which brings more vehicles parked on streets.nI believe the Legislative Districts should be the same as Congressional Districts for simplification purposes.  However, the 2020 Census shows the population is 7,151,502 which needs divided up over 30 Legislative Districts so that each District has 283,383 people in each district."

Park and After it becomes Cactus Road, it provides our favorite park, including a Farmers Market, where teams play baseball and church outings are held:  Roadrunner Park.  Going East we find the Paradise Valley Mall area with extensive shopping, restaurants, Esporta Fitness, medical centers, etc.  The East boundary is Scottsdale Road with great shopping like Kierland Commons, The Promenade,  the Scottsdale Sports Complex, HonorHealth Thompson Peak Medical Center, & Terravita Marketplace.nI urge the Commission to follow all six of the guidelines in the Constitution regarding
redistricting.  I believe these new boundaries are more cohesive and share common interests and places where my community congregate."

"5+ rural Eastern Counties: Gila, Graham, Greenlee, southern Navajo and Apache, San Carlos & White Mtn Apache nations, Copper Corridor (Along SR 77/177: Superior to San Manuel), Verde Valley (Campe Verde etc.). We are natural resources focused, mining, farming, ranching, timber, tourism/recreation. Large amounts of National Forest and limited private land, making our issues of education, water, power, federal land management unique and focused. 5+ Eastern Counties: rural and natural resources focused.nOur region transcends partisan, racial, and gender in local and legislative elections. Our survival depends on navigating common issues in ways that are unique to rural Arizona. The vast majority of our area is federal public lands and tribal, leaving a very small percentage as private for economic development and taxation. From the years 2000 to 2010, the 5 Eastern Counties had a voice in the legislature. In 2010, 15 cities and town across the 5+ East Co.'s, unanimously adopted a resolution to keep 5+ East Co.'s united. That was ignored and we were splintered among the four winds. In 2021, please re-Unite the 5+ rural Eastern Counties."
"This area is meant to cover Graham, Greenlee, Gila, and southern Navajo and Apache Counties. A lot of us share the same religion. I believe most of the area is Catholic or Mormon. Southern Navajo and Apache Counties work at power plants and cattle ranch. Graham, Greenlee, and Gila counties are largely supported by mines and cotton. Mostly though, we are rural Arizona. Many people in the district feel under-represented in the state legislature, specifically in districts 6, 7, 8, and 14. This is what I would like to speak about.n"
"Paulden is physically isolated.  Services are limited to a post office, a fire station and a very small library.  There are no public parks.  There are no large employers in Paulden.  Paulden in an unincorporated place.  People being priced out of Prescott and Prescott Valley and to some extent even Chino Valley wind up here.  Most of the local ""roads"" in Paulden are, in fact, dirt public rights of way that receive no maintenance from the county.nI think the overwhelming majority of residents in Paulden like being largely ignored by Yavapai County.  I also think that the overwhelming majority of residents in Paulden support of current congressional representative Paul Gosar.  Just leave us in the same district and continue to leave us alone.  We enjoy the obscurity."
"Prescott Area: Urban/Semi-Rural - As you may be aware, our CD4 map is one of the oddest outlined AZ maps, as presently constituted.  While compared to Maricopa we could be considered rural, in fact the Quad City area encompasses cities/towns that are more urban, populated by a demographic which is far from rural.  While we are diverse in backgrounds, places of origin, etc., our commonality is our interests (much centered around outdoors and the environment), our economic ties, including where we shop, and how intrinsically tied our lives are because of road corridors, medical facilities, recreation areas.  We have no common cause or interests with the current outer boundaries of CD 4, such as the area West of us, around the Colorado River, or with area near Yuma, or those North and East of The Valley.  When delineating our CD and LD maps, we encourage the commissioners to look at natural/geographic and man-made features, to ensure, among other key factors, easy intra-district access.nFYI,  the Quad Cities are Prescott, Prescott Valley, Chino Valley, Dewey-Humboldt.   The map drawn attempts to use roads, geographic features and county boundaries as a tool for establishing borders. In very broad terms, I am using CR5 from Prescott to Seligman; SR89 from Skull Valley going North; AZ69  from Prescott SE to Cordes Lakes.  We anticipate fair, competitive and bias-free maps, which will make AZ residents proud of an IRC which saw its commitment to Independence as primordial in this process.  I look forward to the next round when we get to opine on the draft maps.   Thank you for giving us the opportunity to voice our concerns and explain our communities."
"I am Ernie Strauch, a 24-year resident of Sedona.  Since arriving in Sedona, I have served 4 years on Sedona City Council, one as Vice-Mayor; Vice-Chair of the Sedona Sustainability Commission, and President of Keep Sedona Beautiful.  I have also served on both Yavapai and Coconino Counties Transportation Committees, and numerous non-profit Boards, Commissions and committees.  I’ll address 2 issues: First,  – the Verde Valley Communities belong together within the same Legislative and Congressional District.  We share- •	Transportation challenges of tourism  •	Medical Care provision and access  •	Workforce Housing – transportation, location, cost and availability •	Locally Integrated, Economic Decision Making – Public Transit Managers, Housing Administrators, and environmental interfacing,   All Valley concerns are integrated-we sink or swim together, particularly as so many Valley communities depend upon the Verde River or tributaries for their economic vitality. A river runs thru us!nWhether our issue involves Arts and Culture, Retail Shopping, Water Supply and Usage, Forest Health and Wildfire Danger or Recreation, the Verde Valley deserves political representation that considers us all a single, strong and vital “Community of Interest”.

The second request I have of the Commission involves Compact Geographical Considerations. 

We ask that you not consider randomly drawn county lines as geographical boundaries, but rather consider natural topographic geography.   Mingus Mountain to our southwest is a serious barrier to transportation and interaction

In contrast, the access to the Flagstaff area is both faster, shorter, and contains more direct integration of the Valley’s Arts, Shopping, Water, Forest Health and Recreation.

In conclusion, for the above reasons, we respectfully request that the Verde Valley communities remain an integral unit within both LD6 and CD1; and that we remain contiguous to, and part of, the greater Flagstaff “Community of Interest”."
"The community of Sedona is accessed only 3 state hwys in and out.  Yet, receives 1.6 million visitors through our northern cities per year. (during the 2020 pandemic it was even more since many people were not flying but driving.)  The closest commercial airport is Flagstaff which since 2008 has been closed.  Everyone who flies anywhere takes a 2+ hour drive to PHX or a $100 round trip 3-hour Shuttle to PHX Sky Harbour airport.  The closet University is  UofA in Flagstaff for forest service and extension/Agra licences/ Fish ad Wildlife offices.  All major purchases like shopping, legal services, car repair, financial, and professional services like Doctors, Labs and Hospitals are in Flagstaff.  Sedona has what are called local or some 'satellite' services for some of the above-mentioned issues but relies on the neighboring Flagstaff and Cottonwood.nVoters who live in Northern Arizona are very different than those who choose to live in a metropolis like the PHX and Tucson.  Lifestyles and demands are very different. PHX is a behemoth that needs to stop spreading and let voters, commerce, and economic demands develop separately."

"Hello, my name is Barbara Carpenter. I live in the City of Kingman in Mohave County, and I am here today to give you information about my communities of interest.

My community, Kingman, is the Mohave County Seat, so many residents of Bullhead City and Lake Havasu City not only come here for the recreational reasons of the higher elevations of the Hualapai Mountains, the county park, hiking and bike trails, but to work in our government offices, e.g., our County Assessor lives in Lake Havasu City and works in Kingman.  Those of us in Kingman spend a lot of time in both Bullhead City at the Colorado River and in Lake Havasu City to enjoy watersports at both locations.  Sam’s Club in Bullhead City is also a big draw for Kingman/Golden Valley/Kingman-New Butler residents. In addition, the Mohave County Fairgrounds provides many events that both Bullhead City and Lake Havasu City residents come to. 


nMany of our Golden Valley residents are employed in Kingman and Bullhead City.  And many Kingman residents spend time in Kingman-New Butler at local eateries, church functions and, last but not least, Mohave Community College.

Up to this point, we have been blessed to remain closely tied to Bullhead City and Lake Havasu City regarding congressional and legislative district boundaries. Please continue to recognize our communities of interest and do not change our legislative district boundaries. 

Thank you for your time today."

"My community includes Oro Valley Hospital, Catalina State Park and the areas at the base of Pusch Ridge on the east down to River Road. On the west it goes nearly to 1-10 to include the Tortolita Mountains and Dove Mountains. Our communities overlap in a variety of ways. This area has a large population of retired people with a good balance of families and school-aged children. It is a suburb of Tucson. It doesn't include rural parts of Pinal County with whom we have little in common. It is compact enough to include the places I frequent, like the Loop on the Rillito and natural areas around and on Pusch Ridge.n"
"The highlighted area roughly defines our part of Arizona.  The more densely populated segments are concentrated in primarily 4 places, separated from each other by about an hour's drive.  The population is heavily weighted toward those of retirement age. Veterans and their families comprise a high percentage of the residents.  Transportation and water rights and usage are priority issues.  Difficult and chronic problems associated with too many  jobs that don't pay a living wage , coupled with the almost-desperate need for adequate housing at affordable costs for all, are endemic.  Adequate health care in these rural areas - for working-age as well as for retired residents - is often a challenge.  These concerns also apply across vast stretches of sparsely populated Arizona.  On the more positive side, there are many charitable and voluntary groups, including local State and Federal organizations, that work together to overcome these barriers by networking across the territory.n"

"This is a rural area subject to considerable development in the past 5 years.  This area is totally tied to the Tucson Metropolitan area and needs to be incorporated into LD and CD that recognizes its affinity to the Tucson area.   It is located west of the Tucson Mountains and south of the desert area of Tucson Mountain Park and Saguaro National Park.  It is bounded on the west by the Tohono O'odham Nation.   People who live here primarily shop and do other activities in the Tucson Metro area.   Most have never driven west to Yuma.nPart of this area is currently split into LD 3 and 4, with the small LD 4 section (2 precincts) affiliated with the Yuma area,, a very long drive away.   This is unworkable and needs to be fixed."
"This is an urban area completely within the Tucson Metro area.  It is a largely Hispanic middle-class area whose residents do virtually all the shopping and all other activities in the Tucson area, especially the ""south side"".    It should be treated as a community of interest.   This area is bounded by I-19.   The population on the east side of I-19 has very similar population.nThe current map has most of the district in LD 3.   4 precincts, however, are in LD 4.  These precincts are bounded by LD 3 and San Xavier.   These residents virtually never travel to the Yuma area, with which they are now affiliated in LD 4.  This entire area should be kept together in one LD, not divided."
"This is the approximate boundary of the Agua Fria High School District. It is bordered on the east by the Agua Fria River and south by the Gila River and MC85. The northern boundary is Northern Ave, and It goes as far west as the Verrado community in Buckeye.
This is a community that dates back to the initial growth of the West Valley over 20 years ago, and continues to expand. We go to church together, we play sports together, and we are defined by long-standing geographic boundaries. Our business community has long been tied together by various clubs and the chamber of commerce.
The Agua Fria school district contains 5 High Schools, but we are currently represented by 4 legislative districts, and 3 congressional districts. As a Governing Board member, this makes it very difficult to grab the attention of our elected legislative representatives, as we only make up a tiny sliver of each of their districts.nThank you for your consideration of the Agua Fria Union High School District. 10 years ago we got chopped up into 4 legislative districts and 3 congressional districts, despite having clear, geographic and community boundaries.  Uniting our community once again in legislative and congressional maps would help ensure our district has a strong voice in the law-making process. Thank you."
"STATEMENT OF THE JEROME TOWN COUNCIL
REGARDING REDISTRICTING

Approved by the Town Council on July 13, 2021

Currently, all Verde Valley towns (Jerome, Clarkdale, Cottonwood, Sedona and Camp Verde) are in the same legislative district but not the same congressional district. Our towns work cooperatively on several levels, and it would be most beneficial if all five towns were in the same legislative and congressional districts.

Jerome requests an outcome that will retain all five Verde Valley towns in the same legislative district, and includes all five in the same congressional district.n"
"All Neighborhoods within this area are rural, have similar needs, concerns and interests. This map incompass' (I hope) ALL of Wickenburg and ALL of Sedona. It has dropped Cave Creek and Anthem, which are more like outskirts of PHX than they are extensions of Yavapai County. The split cities of Wickenburg and Sedona also cause confusion when candidates are running for office, who you can sign petitions for, who you can vote for etc. and combining them would help eliminate this problem.n"
"I am an eight year resident of the City of Sedona residing in Yavapai County. Sedona is divided into two counties: Yavapai and Coconino. We are currently in CD1 and LD6 which leaves the city whole for state and congressional representatiion. I am an elected official, Sedona City Councilor, and we have adopted a statement of values which is being read into the record by our Deputy City Manager. I am speaking for myself. 
Thank you for conducting this listening tour and allowing the public to present its communities of interest commentary before grid maps are drawn. We are all here for the same reason, drawing fair maps which are not gerrymandered for political purposes. 
We view ourselves as a region: Sedona and the Verde Valley. Because our communities share common interests and common problems, we want our representation to be shared as well. Three state legislators and one congressperson. 
Our common interests include eco-tourism, workforce, housing, education, healthcare, waternand the environment, culture, transportation and commerce.
Because our regional population is small and districts are large, we recognize a more populous area will added to meet the equal population standard in our constitution. 
Taking into consideration the additional population, we are tied closely with Flagstaff where we shop (big box stores), where are specialty hospitals and doctors are located, where our tourists traditionally travel (ex. Oak Creek, Grand Canyon, Lake Powell) where the symphony and other cultural events are held, and where we collaborate on watershed management, and environmental concerns. 
We are seeking a competitive district that encourages representatives to be accessible and available to our constituents recognizing all citizens are entitled to be represented. 
We support keeping sovereign lands whole in one legislative and congressional district and not using I-17 to divide the Yavapai-Apache Nation which has tribal lands on both sides of the corridor."
"We are an aging community, underserved in communications and services. There is a lack of employment, educational  and recreational opportunities for younger population causing many to have to leave the area to find employment.n"
"The City of Sedona values a Legislative and Congressional redistricting outcome that first and foremost keeps the City of Sedona intact and does not split the City by county lines.  The City also values an outcome that creates a district that includes both the City of Sedona and the Village of Oak Creek and that maintains the Verde Valley communities of Sedona, Cottonwood, Camp Verde, Jerome, and Clarkdale, as well as the Yavapai Apache Nation, together within a district.

The City of Sedona seeks a Legislative and Congressional District outcome that recognizes the importance of aligning communities of interest.  The City of Sedona values placement within a District with other communities that have similar common interests related to:

•	Economy
•	Infrastructure (Transportation, Broadband)
•	Healthcare Systems
•	Natural Resources (environmental health, forest health, water resources)
•	Economic Development Opportunities
•	Eco-Tourism

"The Verde Valley and Prescott Valley water is what binds our community.  Our local farmers and ranchers are our common bond.  Secondly, we respect our neighbors and promote each other's freedom of religion and expression.   

We believe that less is more where roads and highways are concerned.  We want to work with Yavapai to manage responsible population growth and clean tourism.  Our like-minded principles are conservative leaning.  We take pride in our common sense to conserve our energy and resources within our own neighborhoods, both residential and commercial. 

We appreciate and share great bonds with our local entrepreneurs, craftsmen and farm to table businesses.  And we oppose out-of-state lobbyists imposing their statist regulations on our lifestyles and children.  We managed ourselves without them just fine.  

We believe in limited taxes and government.  And we believe in supporting and preserving our county Sheriff, David Rhodes, and his department. nAll of Sedona fits best into Yavapai county lines as we are a mature senior-leaning community unlike Coconino's University campus-centric community.  In the short term, let's focus on bringing all of Sedona back into the Prescott and Verde Valley district. 

In the long term, we appreciate district boundaries that mirror the shape outline of our county rather than the octopus-looking map comprised of three contorted legs.  How we got here is beyond logic and common sense and begs to be revised .

Residents throughout the Quad cities join together at Christmas time in the Courthouse Square for the Christmas lighting. nCordes Lakes is rural.

"My name is Cara Kretz. My husband Tom and I purchased our dream retirement house in Sedona in 2018. We moved from Chicago and became permanent residents of Sedona in 2019. We chose Sedona because of the beautiful red rocks that surround the town, the weather, the dark sky community, and the rural, small town feel. We also love that Sedona has lots of social activities, churches, and friendly neighbors, 

The maps drawn in 2010 separated the Verde Valley Community by putting Sedona with Flagstaff. That was a mistake.  Sedona, a retirement town, with 42.2% of the population over 65 years old, compared to Flagstaff, basically a college town, with just 8.4 % of the population over 65 years old. 

We consider ourselves part of the rural Verde Valley.  We read the VV Independent Newspaper and Red Rock News.  It is Verde Valley advertisers, who promote their businesses, not Flagstaff advertisers, in local flyers, telephone books and online websites.nThe recently published “Best Place to Live” Relocation Guide combined Sedona/VOC and Verde Valley as one community. We shop in Cottonwood at Wal Mart, and go to Costco in Prescott monthly.  
Most of our medical procedures are at the Cottonwood Hospital. We frequent the restaurants in VOC and Jerome. We plan day trips to Out-of-Africa in Camp Verde, Watson Lake in Prescott and ride the Verde Valley Railroad from Clarkdale. 
Mountains separates Verde Valley and Flagstaff. Residents are cut-off from Flagstaff during a hard rain, snow/ice storm or accident on 89A. The other travel option to Flagstaff is to drive to I-17 via Rt 179 which means going through the traffic bottleneck in uptown Sedona and then on a one-lane highway.  Sedona residents cannot count on a consistent commute and avoid Flagstaff unless absolutely necessary. 
The new maps should our Verde Valley Community together enabling lawmakers to craft policies that represent the commonalities of the community they serve."
"Scattered to the NW of Flagstaff, there are a number of sparsely populated neighborhoods. These neighborhoods may superficially appear to be ""rural"". However, they are not really. Culturally, socially, and economically these neighborhoods are very much part of the city of Flagstaff - even though they are located outside the city limits. The neighborhoods NW of Flagstaff are better represented as outlying areas of the city than as belonging to the rural areas N and E of Flagstaff.nNot to distract from the message, but currently the neighborhoods NW of Flagstaff belong to LD7."

"The area from the foothills of the Tucson Mountains goes along the boundary of Tucson Mountain Park, Saguaro National Park, and the Santa Cruz River.   Shopping is concentrated in the southeastern section of the area.

It should be restored to being in one LD."
"I live in Sedona which is a very unique community in N. AZ. We are an older community with a strong focus on tourism and the arts.  There are lots of independent businesses and people who have retired here. We are concerned with our environment and the majority of our population is well educated. If I was going to choose a like minded community that shares the general vision of Sedona I would say Flagstaff rather than Prescott. Even though a good portion of Sedona is in Yavapai county, we use the resources and services in Coconino County. We shop in Flagstaff, we use the medical services in Flagstaff and a majority of the workforce comes from Flagstaff not Prescott. I feel like it is important to align Sedona with another like minded community rather than make it an island in Northern Az. We have a unique position in our state as a major tourist destination that draws people from all over the world.  It is important that we have the support of a like minded community like Flagstaff.n"
"Rural; common school systems, medical, shopping; transportation (roads); VA hospital; environmental concerns; recreational activities enjoyed by residents and visitors; land use and preservation; fire district cooperation; water conservation/usenI think that Yavapai county meets the requirements of compact, contiguous and preserve community of interest criteria for redistricting. The population and its potential growth in the next 10 years would fit the criteria and make it a logical district. Combining our rural communities with urban counties such as Maricopa does not fit the criteria and would do harm to Yavapai residents."
Dewey Humboldt now has enough population that it should be provided its own political Precinct.  It is currently in Iron 225 and should be put in its own precinct.

"This community borders the Colorado River.  Waters from this river have allowed the area to become a rich agricultural area.  Many people work in agriculture or agriculture related industries.  It also incorporates MCAS, the marine base that brings new young people who shop, work, and socialize in the area.  In addition it includes, Yuma Regional Medical Center which is one of the larger employers.  We also border the boundary with Mexico where we love to shop, see a dentist or visit a pharmacy.

"My community and majority of the population works with service related to small businesses, medical service and independent professional services predominantly in the north central corridor around the Phoenix Mountain Reserve area westward to the I-17, north to I-10, south to Thomas and east to Scottsdale Rd. Many people work at mom & pop shops, restaurants, grocery stores and community public jobs.

I was not living in Arizona the last time around and I have come to understand the following guidelines set forth in our Constitution where not followed as required and there was not enough emphasis on the following of information regarding the communities of interests as well as population equity. I do not feel the communities of Arcadia, Biltmore and that of the Town of Paradise Valley appropriately parallel the rest of the LD 28 communities.

"Redistricting is supposed to create districts of  shared interests. Districts of shared lifestyle, economy, water, jobs, and other issues that impact and complement each other. Since the last redistricting we in southern Navajo County have had no voice on any issues at all. 
We do share very common interests and like issues with the White Mountain Apache Tribe. we share nothing the same with the Navajo Nation.

"I live Doney Park, just outside the city limits of Flagstaff. Although this is an area of multiple neighborhoods, we have shared values and shared interests. We communicate through Facebook and Next-door and organize parades, group dinners, other events and charitable activities. When we need services, we ask for recommendations for neighbors so that we can support locals and keep our dollars in our area. The one thing we don't share is our representation in state government. We are evenly split between LD6 and LD7. As a result our voices are diluted because we are speaking to two different sets of senators and representatives. All of Doney Park should have the same representation and that should be the same as Flagstaff. The amount of money we manage to keep in Doney Park is small compared to what we spend in Flagstaff. All of the stores and services that we access are in Flagstaff. We need our voices to join theirs when speaking to our legislature.n"

5 churches w/less 10 cars, and several individuals attempting to work out of their homes or garages. Also, there is Henry Cordes Park, Community Center, a small park w/dried up cow tank that Cali's choose to call a lake. there are NO lakes.
Residents live in everything from dilapidated, rain leaking, single wide trailer trash to many double wide mfr homes to multi hundreds of thousand dollar homes on the hill.

God Bless you all in this asgnmt.
I find it very hard to be so bold as to draw lines on this map, so I will verbally try to communicate in an effort to share my feelings and recommendations.
I reside in the community of Cordes Junction, Yavapai Cty, Mayer PO 86333, 19 yrs.
Our community IS integral with the Prescott Quad cities domain, most of CJ residents
as best I KNOW, shop, worship, health, med, pharm, groceries, play, etc, there.
I am a Vietnam Vet, retired and utilize the VA sys for my med needs. 
We seldom go south on I17 to Anthem or Miracopa. Likewise, the same for Camp Verde or Cottonwood, an annual trip there is the norm. 
I hope and watch the IRC, in lines drawn, proposed. You will hear from me again.

Please think community, not race, party, or other racist PC criteria.
We are AMERICANS.

"All of Yavapai County.  Yavapai County is politically one community.  All residents must pay taxes in Yavapai, they are served by the Yavapai County Sheriff and  the County Board of Supervisors.  They are called to jury duty in Yavapai County Courts.  Regarless of where they shop, their political unit is Yavapai County .nYavapai County should be completely with in a single LD and CD.  Those districts should as much as possible be compact (Square) districts.  In no case should any part of Maricopa County be in the same LD or CD as Yavapai County."

"My community is comprised almost exclusively of Navajo people. We live in rural northeastern Arizona in an area lacking many government services and economic development. Many of our people, and especially our politically engaged elders, speak Navajo exclusively. Unemployment is high, but community, family, and traditional clan bonds tie us together to support one another. Many of our experiences are common before the state and the federal government and we deserve for our voice to be magnified and not diminished in any proposed redistricting.n"
"Our region is unique. It is rural and in so, we deal with rural issues. Our survival depends on navigating common issues in ways that are unique to rural Arizona. The vast majority of our area is federal public lands and tribal, leaving a very small percentage as private for economic development and taxation. There should be no line separating this district.

"This is roughly the area of Corona de Tucson. The community began as a retirement area in 1963. Since the late 1980s, it has become more of a Tucson bedroom community with most of its current residents commuting to the city for work. The area has a few local businesses, three churches, two fire stations, two elementary schools, one middle school & one high school. There are no public parks operated by Pima County. There is a wildlife research area behind the community that is off limits to the public aside from research by special permission.  The main community groups are tied to the VFW, the neighborhood watch associations & the Corona de Tucson fire department. The area is serviced by City of Tucson water/sewers, & TriCo Electric. The main roads are Sahuarita Road (east-west), Houghton Road, South Wilmot Road, & Wentworth Road (north-south).  All of these highways are two lane roads that are unlit, in degraded condition & flood regularly that see frequent, fatal accidents.nCorona de Tucson is a part of Pima County, Arizona Legislative District 14 & Arizona Congressional District 2, meaning that its voice is drowned out by the city of Tucson in almost all matters concerning Federal Elections & county representation. This area pays high cost of living rates in the form of water usage & property tax but receives little to no county services from adequate road maintenance to civic centers & law enforcement. The current districting of southeastern Arizona nullifies the voice of rural residents by pairing us with at least half of urbanized Tucson. Tucson city limits do not reflect the actual population distribution of this region: highways do. Urban Tucson should have its own congressional district, legislative districts & voting precincts that are wholly separate from rural Pima County, Cochise County, Greenlee County & Graham County. Pima County is currently being governed as an entity of the city of Tucson thanks to the current boundaries of the districts."
"The region marked on the map contains Flagstaff, Sedona, Village of Oak Creek, and Verde Valley.  These areas share many community aspects that are highly interdependent of one another.   Economic factors such as a shared workforce, ecotourism, arts, etc. Along with this, these areas, regardless of politics, share much of the same culture and ideals when it comes to their community.  n"
"The area drawn on the map is eastern Arizona, geographically representative of the largest stand of Pondarosa Pines, Mogollon Rim, Verde Valley, the copper corridor, and rural.

"Oro Valley, Marana and Casas Adobes are so tied together that without a marker you wouldn’t know when you left one and entered the other. All three are suburban with a mixture of homes, apartments, businesses, parks and churches. They all have large shopping malls and a variety of grocers. The majority of our populations own their own homes and speak English. Even the median incomes are similar ranging from $65-$85,000 annually. All three have populations that reflect are balanced across age groups. Oro Valley’s median age is about 50, Marana’s is 40 and Casas Adobes’ median age is 42.  There exist strong community ties between all three places, all were established before the 1980’s and we often shop, work, worship across our boundaries. The school systems are all rated well above the state average. All three places share the same concerns about clean water availability, ensuring safe neighborhoods and maintaining a healthy balance between development and open spaces.nOro Valley has little in common with the current places in LD11 that lie in Pinal Co. My neighbors and I have no connection to Maricopa City, Saddlebrook, Arizona City, Casa Grande, Red Rock, Ak-Chin Village, Stanfield, Eloy and Picacho.  LD11 only contains a portion of three of these Pinal County places. Case Grande is about 21% in LD11 while Eloy is only 2.5% and Picacho is 56%.  Our new boundaries should not be composed of these  small community splits which decrease all of the residents’ voices and make it extremely difficult to even identify shared community interests. Tucson is our central hub. Residents of Oro Valley, Marana and Casas Grande go to downtown Tucson and the University of Arizona for arts and entertainment. Phoenix is the central hub for many of the places in Pinal County. Marana and Casas Adobes are contiguous areas that should be combined with Oro Valley as a community of interest. All are located in Pima Co. and share Oracle and I-10 as major thoroughfares."
"The Regional COI of Flagstaff-Sedona-Village of Oak Creek-Verde Valley should be contained in the same legislative and congressional districts.    Our workforces travels up/down I-17 and Hwy 89A and so do our tourists.   I live in Flagstaff.   Of course, I bring my visitors to the Grand Canyon but I also bring them to Jerome and Cottonwood and Sedona and to restaurants in the Village of Oak Creek after hiking Bell Rock.  I hike, shop and dine out all over this region.   When I have less ambulatory visitors, we take driving tours.    

In this part of Northern Arizona, we do not stay on one side of the tracks or one side of the highway to work, play or shop.   I-40, Rt 66 and I-17 would not make sensible district boundaries.nPlease keep all of the greater Flagstaff area, Sedona, the Village of Oak Creek and the Verde Valley in the same legislative and congressional districts. 

The ""Verde Valley"" refers to the Yavapai County precincts on the east side of Mingus Mountain.   It is currently in two congressional districts and two legislative districts.  Specifically, Jerome, three Cottonwood precincts and the precinct of Creek (216) are CD4.  The rest of the Verde Valley is in CD1.   Clarkdale and one Cottonwood precinct are in LD7. The rest of the Verde Valley is in LD6.    

The greater Flagstaff area should also be kept whole. The precincts of Schultz (51), Mountain View (86), Winona (92) and Fort Valley East (55) are currently in LD7, but they are intertwined with Flagstaff and should be in the same legislative district.   Flagstaff is currently in LD6.   

Thank you for your consideration."
My community of interest is Yavapai County plus the portion of Sedona that is Coconino County. This is a natural community of interest with similar age populations and interests. Having our community include Flagstaff is meaningless with their much younger population and different areas of interest.n

"This community has nothing in common with Tucson Arizona, which is what district e are part of. A new West Valley district needs to be established.

Thank Youn"
"My community is Sedona, as part of the greater Verde Valley/Flagstaff area.  Eco tourism, healthcare via Northern Arizona Health, higher education via NAU, transportation, housing, water and resource preservation, forest management, engaged and thriving arts, civic engagement, recreation, shopping and dining knit this area together.nMy community sphere is mostly Sedona and Flagstaff.  I do see the sensibility of keeping the entirety of the Verde Valley contiguous.  It makes no sense that Cottonwood and Jerome are in another CD as they are part of the Verde Valley.  The Mingus Mountains provide a natural barrier with the Prescott area.  Other than a very occasional shopping trip to Costco and Trader Joe's in Prescott, I have no connection with Prescott/Quad Cities."
Want to make sure district alignment focuses on like and close communities such as keeping Prescott and sedona with verde valley are kept together n
"My community of interest centers around the town of Flagstaff. The town of Flagstaff shares many qualities that make a common community. The list of qualities would include shared resources like water, employment opportunities, transportation, access to the peaks and recreation. We also share many ties to the Navajo nation to the Northeast. We share family ties as well as health resources like Sacred Peaks Health Care Center. nI want the commission to know, I strongly support the city of Flagstaff being placed in a single legislative district. I would be opposed to splitting Flagstaff into two separate legislative districts."
"My community of interest centers around Ina and Thornydale, where we live but extends from the freeway to Sabino Canyon, to River Road to Pinal County.  Our kids attended MUSD schools, played sports at Arthur Pack Park (Thornydale and Overton).  We attend church in this area and shop the major stores.  We serve as LD PCs from Sabino Canyon to I 10. Our gym is in this area and we hike  at Catalina State Park.  This is a compact community where we speak English, have traditional values and work jobs for a living.nWe are asking the commission consider the populations in the areas of interest so the redistricting lines represent all the populations equally that live in Arizona."
"The last IRC 10 years ago put us in with Yavapai LD1 so that we are represented by a state senator and two representatives that really do not represent our area interests. Our COI is along Carefree Hwy east to Cave Creek and Carefree to dine, doctor, shop, entertainment, and west along Carefree Highway north to Anthem and south along I-17 to dine, shop, doctor, entertainment, church, work, and airports. We never go up to Yavapai County (Prescott) for anything. It would be more helpful for Black Canyon City in Yavapai be included with us since they often travel south toward Phoenix.nOur LD1 in Maricopa County includes 3 CDs, CD4, CD6, and CD8. CD6 and CD8 make sense because it is east and west areas along Carefree Hwy. 
CD8 could be improved so it is not such a long stretch from the northern Maricopa County border down south to Avondale.
CD4 could be greatly improved so it doesn’t stretch from the southern Arizona border to the northern AZ border and then from the western AZ border east and south to Florence.
Please consider my family’s and political district’s  ‘community of interests’ and put us back where we belong legislatively in Maricopa County alone, not mis-matched in with Yavapai County where the IRC put us with 10 years ago. We never go up to the Prescott area for anything. Thank you again for your consideration."
"Sunnyside represents about 10% of the flagstaff population and is primarily comprised of Hispanic, Black, Native, and mixed race constituents who are considered as being in an underserved community.nMy name is JB DeWitt, I’m here representing the Sunnyside Neighborhood Association of Flagstaff.

We feel that it is extremely important that this commission take into account communities of interest, that cities and communities are held whole, and to be sure that everyone is represented and that means districts that will allow our representatives to actually be representatives of us.

If Flagstaff is split between districts we will be unable to be properly represented on issues that are very specific to us, such as:

* Housing inflation & rental prices
* Small Business
* Dominant minority groups within Sunnyside and the Flagstaff area
* Education


We also feel that the census has been undercounted and that we should be asking the governor to call on our federal government for a census recount.

Finally, we appreciate the strong stance that our mayor and city council have taken; we support them on this and we wish to thank them for continuing to advocate for us.

Thank You."
"The community is Sedona-Verde-Flagstaff. These all  share an economy based on sustainable tourism (ST): lodging and cultural/recreation based businesses  that promote the well being of people and environment. While ST is the critical underlying engine that will sustain us during the coming decade; shared medical and educational opportunities serve our aging residents and younger visitors. The hotter, drier climate, calls for  conservation  and protection of  our water resources, and the region’s natural ecosystems. 

 Fires in the Flagstaff/Verde Valley affect regional air quality and create flooding hazards. The regions’ growing ST economy  requires policies that protect its natural beauty and resources and the health of residents and visitors alike.

"I have lived in Sedona, in the Verde Valley, for 20 years. At the Yavapai County Listening meeting I heard you ask for information of the direction a district should expand in order to encompass more population. I'm adding to my previous comments by urging that the communities of the Verde Valley, including the Yavapai-Apache Nation, be retained as a contiguous district, with any needed expansion by all logic and custom adding lands to the north/northeast - Oak Creek Canyon, Flagstaff and the small settlements in the vicinity of Flagstaff. Mingus Mountain and the Black Hills impose  significant barriers to travel between most of the Verde Valley and the Quad-Cities area, making it nearly twice as far (about 1.5 hours one-way) from most parts of the VV as Flagstaff (1 hour from Cottonwood, 40 minutes from Sedona.) Prescott is in the Prescott National Forest, the VV is in the Coconino National Forest, which is administered out of Flagstaff. Prescott is an Active  (continued below)nManagement Area for groundwater  regulation, which also impacts development, while the VV and Flagstaff are not so restricted. But perhaps the clearest demonstration of the divergent interests of Prescott and the VV are demonstrated in the difficulties encountered by the Yavapai County Supervisors  as they attempt to govern both areas of the county. Despite their best efforts, disputes regularly arise due to the different needs of the two, with the result that citizens in the Verde Valley often feel treated like an unfavored stepchild.
For these and the facts stated in my prior comment, I sincerely hope that any needed expansion of the Verde Valley's legislative and congressional districts be to the north/northeast to Flagstaff rather than to the west toward Prescott and the Quad-Cities.

"Flagstaff is tied together by love of the environment.

I am not a Mormon, redneck rancher or Trump supporter yet those folks are dictating how my neighborhood should be. I believe in science, facts and believe policy should be data driven.

"The economy of the outlined region is predominantly driven by tourism, and thus susceptible to tourists' ability to travel and enjoy the natural, cultural and commercial amenities. For the past 10 years, District 6 included  Holbrook and the southern Mogollon Rim region thus splitting the Flagstaff area and creating a region of little commonality- a result of purposeful gerrymandering.  The drawn region all depend on the Coconino aquifer, except for Grand Canyon area (Oak Creek supplying Sedona emanates from the Coconino Aquifer).  Water is a common concern and communities of interest can be defined, in part, by there water source. This region lies within the Coconino & Kaibab National forests and faces the same threats of forest fires. Nearly all residents are in the 4-FRI forest management area. This region is mixed in its' political character with nearly equal voter registration in Dem, Ind, Rep.  making this a competitive district.  I-40, I-17, Hwy 89  serve as transport arteries.nAll Districts must be competitive following the below.  If one District is politically imbalanced, then an alternative District should counterbalance.
Districts must include equal number of voters and meet all  IRC prescriptions.
Native American communities should remain whole with different tribes potentially being coalesced to maintain their voice. Bands within a nation constitute a community of interest.
Watershed and natural resource boundaries can guide IRC drafting maps as resources drive the sustainability of communities and cultures.
2010 and 2020 Census Bureau data need to be balanced in defining population regions due to potentially incomplete data collection in the 2020 census. 
The Declaration of Independence affirming the rights to all humans needs to be periodically read aloud at the IRC meetings.  While the challenge is great, the responsibility to assure equal rights, including voting, to all Arizona citizens is paramount and should not be trivialize in any manner."
"The communities of Southern Navajo county are united in their efforts to preserve our environment, the forest, and further the economic development of the area.

We currently are in Congressional District 1 and Legislative District 7. Due to the size of both Districts is the same as the state of Pennsylvania. 

With the size of these districts half of our population is bound to feel unrepresented. And they are! 

Districts should be compact to accurately represent communities of interest who live and work together. 

 A new Congressional District 1 and Legislative district 7, or whatever you decide to call these new districts, should accurately represent communities of interest which is require by State and Federal law. 
 
I recommend keeping both Congressional and Legislative Districts the same size and map, which keeps both representation the same on a State Level and Federal level for common interests.n
Communities to the North as you see on the map there made up primarily of rock and high desert plateau, with a vast valley of ranchland, and agriculture between the two regions.

Please do not include us in a legislative district with these Northern cities and Reservation. The White Mountain communities need to be with other White Mountain communities of the same Interests. These interests are non-partisan and are for the common good in our locales and region.

"Sedona / Greater Verde Valley / Flagstaff share many common issues.  Generally rural, large tourism base, much open space, outdoor recreation, water resources.  Flagstaff serves as a point of additional services for healthcare, shopping and cultural activities.  We share a diverse community including Native American and Latino populations.  When we travel from our small towns, it is much more often to Flagstaff than to Prescott.  nI want the IRC to create competitive districts where the best candidate can win.  Noncompetitive districts create extremes.  To the best of my knowledge in my LD6 one party has won all State Senate and State Representative positions for the last 10 years.  Noncompetitive districts corrode trust in democracy."

We believe in helping others and in personal accountability and self reliance. We are close knit and we take care of our own. At the risk of sounding cliche, we are good, salt of the earth Americans. We are givers, builders, improvers. We spend time outdoors. We are vested in our schools and strive for greatness academically, athletically, and musically.

"My Community of Interest is the Nogales area. My community is basically a bilingual Hispanic population. We have enjoyed robust trading with our friends in Mexico and depend on their purchasing power to assist our local economy. This also contributes to the financial resources of the city of Nogales, as the city has no property tax. Our community is in dire need of more affordable housing and recreational facilities. 
Presently our largest employers are government at all three levels. Another large employer is our produce industry which serves as a positive influence in all aspects of tourism and commerce. They take a step forward to enhance our quality of life.
We are a very unique community as we celebrate with pride our heritage and always honor our patriotism as proud citizens of this country.

We have supported forest health and wildfire mitigation with extra tax dollars, and we struggle with affordable housing and how to manage the growing vacation rentals.

"Our area is very unique.   We have multiple Forests.   We have multiple National Parks.    We have multiple Indian Reservations.  This makes our area much different than the area around Maricopa County and Pima County.    The incorporated area of Flagstaff is very small and yet the impact of City regulations effects a much broader area.   The impact of the rights of the Native Americans in our region that do not match the rest of the community affect our area much differently than other parts of the State.    The effects of care, or lack thereof, of our Forests is currently effecting flooding in our region.    The visitors to the National Parks and Forests in our region have significant impact on our region.    We need representation that understands that our ""small community"" is actually a very large area and requires legislative attention.   By lumping our area with the southern portion of the State does not allow for equal representation.  nWe need representation that understands both rural and city living.     We have lots of low density properties in this area.       It is time that large unincorporated areas are counted for representation.

"Non-native American towns need be within like community districts to work together on common issues, such as lack of residential Fiber internet for Show Low, but less than 45 min away - Eagar / Springerville does not), saving farm / ranches from excessive taxation / overregulation, cleaning up / maintaining our shared forest to prevent forest fires (Apache Sitgreaves), recruiting knowledge based-employment in rural communities such as Vernon, Concho / Eagar / Springerville/ Alpine / Greer, further growth expansion of Northland Community College.  Most Rural shoppers in those towns tend spend the majority of their money for supplies and entertainment in Show Low area.  The LDS church stake center for those same communities are in Show Low and these non-rural residents have been trying to become part of Navajo County for decades due to lack of representation. (Locally, it is viewed as a gerrymandered county where non native Americans have no voice). Pls prevent this during redistricting.nThe non-native rural towns just outside of Navajo county to the NE are losing businesses and residences, lag behind in internet infrastructure, and their businesses are being targeted for elimination because they have no representation at the county level.  They end up having to speak to the Representative from the Show slow area in order to receive consideration from elected officials.  They are depressed, dismayed and feel dejected at their loss of voice in local and state government.  Furthermore, most of these residents work in the Winslow, Snowflake or Show Low area.

From 2000 to 2010, the 5 Eastern Counties had a voice in the legislature. In 2010, a resolution was adopted to keep the 5+ Counties united. However, that resolution was ignored.
Now we residents of the 5+ Eastern Counties are asking to be put back together."
"The 5 rural Eastern Counties including Gila, Graham, Greenlee, Southern Navajo & Apache Counties, San Carlos & the White Mountain Apache Nations, the Copper Corridor,  and the Verde Valley. 
These rural counties share specific features as Communities of Interest and are focused on natural resources-lumber (wildfires), recreation/tourism, hunting, ranching, agriculture, jobs, education, power, water and Federal land management. 
The 5+ Eastern Counties are rural and natural resources focused.n*The Map above is approximate.
This rural region of Arizona is specifically focused on local issues. The success of this district depends upon finding solutions to those common issues. The majority of land in this area is Federal & Tribal Lands. The tax base in the rural region depends upon a small percent of land for economic development and taxation. 
Between the year 2000 and 2010, this region had a voice in the Arizona Legislature. At the time  of the last redistricting, 15 cities and towns across the 5+ Eastern Counties signed a resolution to keep the area united. However, that resolution was rejected and the rural counties were split. 
In 2021, we rural residents are asking that the 5+ Eastern Counties be reunited."
"The Coconino Regional Community of Interest shares environmental conditions including water resource scarcity, rural conditions, high desert landscape, farming, and ranching.  It also shares economic and social inter-dependency.   nMajor roadways such as I-40, I-17, Route 66; State roads such as 89, 89A, 180 should NOT be used to artificially bisect communities, e.g., Flagstaff, Sedona, Camp Verde, Page, etc. Communities need to be kept whole.  Tribal lands should be kept whole.  Coconino Regional COI is rural and lies in northern Arizona. As such, it should not include the urban areas of Maricopa or Pima counties."
"Cochise County is a large rural county with a significantly large population relative to some other counties in Arizona, and has a unique local culture of rugged western individualism and freedom.nThe IRC should seriously consider adding an additional site for a public hearing specifically for Cochise County. Sierra Vista would be the preferred location as it is the largest population center in the county and easily accessible by major roads. I believe the high school auditorium that seats about 1000 people has been used for this purpose in the past. A remote location in Bisbee for a meeting in Nogales (Santa Cruz County) is insufficient. The demographics and communities of interest in Bisbee and Nogales are very different from most of  Cochise County."
"Snowflake is part of Congressional District 1 at this time. Boundaries of the district are such that the balance of voters are tipped to favor the Democrat Party, giving the conservative base no representation. I have lived here 15 years and have yet to see, meet, or hear from a Congressional Representative. The district is one of the 11 largest districts in the nation, and incudes a very diverse geographical demographic. Our rural needs are unique. We have zero representation in certain parts of the district. Current representative seems focused on the Navajo Nation and the Flagstaff area. While I love my neighbors on the Navajo Nation, they are a sovereign nation, do not contribute to the property tax base, entitled to services, and have a large influence on elections. They receive federal government monies that could be better used to serve their people, in my observation. Our legislative districts need to be balanced.n"
"Beyond issues submitted by my wife, my comments are that our congressional district is too large to be represented adequately. We have lived here 15 years and still do not have adequate broadband, which hinders our community and ability to grow and bring jobs to our communities. We are a diverse district, we are not being represented. The boundaries as they sit leave little chance to be represented by someone with conservative values.n"
"Rural area that is made up of mostly hard working, self-reliant families and individuals. nAs a registered Independent voter, I believe the current legislative district is much too large and doesn't provide proper representation for the diverse population in said district.  It seems that the current representatives cater to the populations in the northern part of the district and ignore the remaining population. I have seen countless social media posts by them showing the multitude of improvements to the northern areas yet the southern areas have similar issues they consistently ignore! They even ignore countless requests to speak to their constituents in the southern portion of their district. I honestly feel disenfranchised by the current representation and feel the district should be broken into smaller sections so our issues can be addressed and hopefully improved upon."
"I agree with the map Sylvia Allen submitted, specifically with the one where the Apaches are included because they are integral to our community.  

I hire Apache bands, welders, and have many Whiteriver residents who vend/play at my bar in Lakeside every weekend.   

I agree with those boundaries bc I bring in food trucks from Globe, Heber, Snowflake, Whiteriver, and all around that forested, mountainous areas, rural, ranching, mining community and their support services.

Amusingly, when my husband and I planned our honeymoon, we planned on destinations in Coconino and Yavapai Counties.  We viewed that as a vacation whereas heading to Miami or Springerville could be for a range of reasons.

As for today's meeting, the fractal nature of the gentleman explaining the existing LD boundaries dissolve as the people ripped out the artificial plastic tape boundaries between our rows to sit down in community was not lost on me and I hope all of you heard these under represented people.
 
nAs for representation, I am guilty of making David Peelman and Walt Blackman drive more, beyond their huge boundaries.  I called and asked them to take questions from our community at two of our bars in Souther Apache and Southern Navajo County.

When we launched a protest to allow 55 vendors access to markets because of EO 2020-43, those guys drove to our bar in Lakeside and another one in Concho to speak to the people who had so many questions and whose actual legislators & representatives were not addressing.  

In fact, my market manager called everyone around the state and asked them to come speak at our protest market.  Rep Blackman, Mr Peelman, Wendy Rogers, and a few others actually attended and took questions.  None of them are our elected leaders.  

To find out about my representation, I signed up for Google alerts for their names to learn what they are actually doing because they don't talk to us. They don't need to with the existing boundaries."

"My community resides on the Navajo Nation and is split apart by Apache, Navajo, and Coconino counties. My community is Kayenta and Dennehotso, Arizona. I am apart of the larger community that is the Navajo Nation Reservation. Our shared interests include the Navajo language that is still spoken and taught among our communities, and the Navajo Culture that is also shared, taught, and practiced daily among the Navajo Nation citizens. Government employment is a shared interest of the community that includes U.S. gov't boarding schools, U.S. gov't Indian Health Services clinics and hospitals, U.S. gov't Postal services, and Department of Economic Services. Navajo Nation government is a shared community interest that provides services such as local government chapter houses, police departments, social services, behavioral health, Navajo Nation dept of forestry, transportation, and rangers. My community celebrates events like Navajo Nation fair, pow-wow, rodeos, and flea markets. I am NavajonI feel that the NN border towns take away from our community interests. These border towns are included into our local counties with no shared interests other than buying necessities, healthcare and education from these places. They are a different demographic that is added in for no reason other than to sway politics, and that effects NN residents and its special community interests. Politicians and border town government only attend NN events when it suits their interests for election and then abandon the Navajo communities who voted them in. These elected officials do not give back in any capacity to the NN to bring their business and services. I feel they should be excluded and removed from our counties. A new county or counties that are solely focused on NN residents and communities Has To Be created to bring about equal and fair opportunities that will have long lasting positive effects because of the growing NN population.  We NEED better state and county representation for NN."

"Twenty years ago my family moved from Tucson to Patagonia.  The decision was carefully considered.  We wanted access to all that Tucson could offer, but equally important was to be in a rural community that valued the beauty of our desert, would work together to protect our desert plants and wildlife, our water, our air and our dark skies, and would explore ways to make such work economically sustainable (eco-tourism, educational programs, local businesses, etc). The Santa Cruz River valley, the surrounding mountains and highlands, and the communities of people in the area beautifully fit that goal, and we purchased land and built a house.  As threat to the area increases, we need governance that represents people living the greater region of Santa Cruz County AND Sahaurita and Green Valley.n"
"These boundaries represent the areas that I do the following:  live, eat, hike, work out, shop, have friends, go to church, go to the movies, drive, and feel most at homenI urge you to make the LDs and CDs as competitive as possible.   I see that as  your charge.  Competitive districts do the following: a. Fair districts protect against extremism and focus the elected representative on the need to solve the problems of voters in the district. b.Fair districts encourage bipartisan cooperation. c.Fair districts result in elected reps who are more responsive to their diverse constituency. d.	Fair districts result in higher quality candidates because candidate quality will matter more in races where the outcome is not predetermined. e.Competitive districts encourage higher levels of civic engagement and voter participation because races are not a forgone conclusion
My district, LD 28, is a great example of a fair district producing significant levels of civic involvement, voter participation, quality candidates and responsive elected representatives."

"Gila County  consists of rural communities, tied together by the County government   nYou must create FAIR and COMPETITIVE  districts, while also protecting   the voting power of our communities of color.   . 

When we have non-competitive districts, the party in power has no incentive to listen to the minority party.  When the numbers are  lopsided, the minority party has no  voice and no hope of having a voice.  Without competition, the quality of candidates, on both sides, deteriorates,  
When districts are competitive, however, elected officials  must answer to the voters. 
The minority party knows that  the next election cycle will bring new opportunities to get their candidate elected.  When districts are competitive, EVERY VOTE  MATTERS.  

Arizona is a purple state.  Neither party has a huge lead over the other, and a full one third of voters are independents.  This makes our state very competitive at the Federal level, for Presidential and US Senate candidates. 

Let’s make our districts purple, too, and assure that EVERY VOTE TRULY MATTERS.

Income levels are diverse, and population is ethnically and racially diverse.nPlease do what you can to create competitive districts so that voters are treated equally and their votes matter in the selection of representatives in Congress.

"This is the area where I live, work, often hike, walk my dog and take her to the dog park, go to church, go shopping and to the movies and restaurants.  When my children were younger, they went to schools within this area.  Many of my friends live within this area, and many of my children's friends did too. I like that there is a mix of expensive and inexpensive housing within it.  My kids' friends at Arcadia High included some living in small houses and apartments and getting free lunches as well as some with lots of money. I use light rail from my office to the airport within this area.nI really care about politically competitive districts.  I would like very much for my state and federal representatives to believe that they need to listen to all the people in their districts, and solicit and have to have votes from Democrats, Republicans and Independents.  Candidates should not be catering only to the primary voters from one party, knowing that whoever that narrow, partisan group of voters chooses will be dispositive as a practical matter."
"The area surrounding the City of Flagstaff should be kept in one LD as we share an economy, water resources, recreational resources, and we value dark skies.  We value and respect nature, we believe supporting public education is vital. Unfortunately, in 2011 redistricting, some areas immediately outside of Flagstaff were left out of the LD that represents our community. These neighborhoods can easily be identified as Precincts 51 (Schultz), 55 (Fort Valley East), 86 (Mountain View), and 92 (Winona). Please add these to the legislative district that is now LD 6 and keep the other precincts surrounding Flagstaff in the district. This would include the areas as far west as Parks, south to Kachina Village and Mountainaire (the Pumphouse Wash precinct), east to Winona, north to include Sunset Crater National Monument on the east and Kendrick Mountain on the west.nThis COI is too small for its own LD, but this area should be kept together as part of an LD. Most logically that LD would include Sedona, the Verde Valley, and Grand Canyon, which share an economy based on tourism, a watershed, and forests. These communities cooperate in the fields of public safety and healthcare so the ability to communicate with one set of legislators on these vital issues makes sense. 

For a CD, Flagstaff fits best with areas to the east and north and Yavapai County east of Mingus Mountain and the counties running down the eastern border of the state, including Apache, Gila, Graham, Greenlee, Cochise, and the eastern rural half of Pinal. We have more in common in terms of natural resource challenges, national parks and monuments, and Dark Sky values than we have with the Colorado River communities in Mohave, La Paz, Yuma. Furthermore, the IRC should strive to give rural Arizona two voices in Congress. The vast rural resources deserve that much voice in D.C."
"Includes the Navajo Nation, and reservations of the Hopi, White Mountain Apache, and San Carlos Apache, along with the non-reservation portions of Navajo and Apache Counties. nI think the most important community of interest are the Native Americans from the Navajo Nation, and Hopi, White Mountain Apache and San Carlos Apache Tribes. They absolutely need to be kept together. The next Community of Interest we need to protect is Navajo County. Currently, Snowflake, Taylor, Holbrook, Pinedale, Clay Springs, Heber and Overgaard are clawed away to add population to districts farther west. As many witnesses said on Saturday, this causes great confusion on which legislators represent which area of Navajo County. Another problem with the current arrangement is that splitting Show Low from Snowflake, and Linden from Pinedale weakens the voice of central county residents and makes them feel alienated. Many of them testified about this. The best solution is to keep all of Navajo County in Legislative District 7. Legislative District 7 would be better for having this additional population."
"My comments are simple and straightforward. It is vitally important to our democracy that the IRC follow the provisions of voter approved Prop 106 to ensure that the new districts which will impact all of us for the next 10 years are fair & competitive. Our democracy cannot survive with one party in power with no obligation to listen to & address the needs of all constituents, not just those who voted for them. Further, fair and competitive districts will protect against the extremism that we are currently seeing across the nation which is again, a threat to our democracy.nAdditionally, I cannot stress enough how important it is that the voting power of the communities of color be protected pursuant to the Voting Rights Act. Over the last 10 years, Arizona has become a more diverse state and we must ensure that our communities of color are able to elect candidates of their choice to ensure that their voices are heard and needs are met. 

I appreciate the opportunity the IRC has given to provide input on the significant task that is before them. I am also grateful for the IRC member's willingness to do this difficult work.

Please note that I drew the map roughly based on my current LD but only because I could not submit comments without drawing a map. As my comments above have indicated, I am more interested in fair and competitive districts and ensuring that communities of color are protected. I also note that I provided these same comments at the July 25th public meeting. 

Thanks!"

"My name is Harry Oberg, and I was raised in and live in Prescott.  I am a former mayor of Prescott, and currently a Supervisor in Yavapai County.  

Currently our county is split between CD4 and CD1, and LD1 and LD6.  This arrangement fragments and dilutes our communities of interest for local issues, and legislative and congressional representation. This can be corrected by ensuring that all of Yavapai County becomes its own LD.  And, when creating the new CD, Yavapai County should not be splintered, but rather, joined in its entirety with other rural counties that share our western spirit, culture, and common interests.  Prior to the last IRC redistricting, Yavapai County was honored with the designation of CD1.  There was a good reason for this as Prescott was twice the territorial capital of our state.  I would ask that the commission recognize this unique history and restore its designation of CD 1.   

 Our western heritage is a major community of interest in Yavapai county.nWe cherish and want to sustain our deep western roots of cattle ranching, mining, agriculture, forestry, and rodeo competitions that define and represent our way of life.    
Our residents from former urban areas tell us that they moved to Yavapai County to experience our rural and small-town atmosphere.  They want to sustain this rural lifestyle and are extremely concerned about our water and the increasing demand for water by metro Phoenix.  The Verde River is one of Arizona’s last wild and scenic rivers and is a significant source of water for Phoenix.  This river is vital to our county’s ranching, agricultural, and mining interests.  In drawing the new CD maps, our county should be joined intact with other rural counties that appreciate the need to protect and sustain our water resources for rural community interests.      
I can assure you the citizens of this county want our historic western lifestyle to be preserved and not splintered as in previous redistricting.  

Thank you!"
"The Wickenburg-Congress-Yarnell communities should be included in the same state legislative and U.S. congressional districts.

Many residents of Yarnell and Congress attend and/or are members at churches in Wickenburg.

They also include places where I volunteer with like-minded citizens for environmental projects or community efforts, e.g., buffelgrass removal or trash cleanup. Most of the people I care most about personally live in this area and it is important to me that we are represented politically by one voice.  I chose to live on the central/ west side because it is the core of the ""Old Pueblo"" and includes the University area, ASDM, Mission Gardens, the Santa Cruz, and the major washes that drain into it.

Tucson opted for desert landscaping and water banking when Phoenix was deluded by its Salt River Project resources to think that water was an infinite resource. Tucson has produced some of the most significant ecological, hydrological, and astronomical research--a place that cares deeply about the environment.

"In northern Arizona a major feature is social, economic reliance on the natural environment, especially National Park and National Forests. Two major drivers:  Tourism and so-called working landscapes. Tourism  supports thousands of jobs, billions in spending, and many local businesses. Working landscapes, used for livestock ranching and for forest management, are relied upon for food production, recreation, increasingly renewable energy production. We partner with the Forest Service on forest health, watershed protection, and fire risks. Landscapes shape our positions on state and federal policy.

Four issues where our region deserves its own representation…
	1) Dark skies protection 
	2) Depend on surface water and on regional aquifers, but not in an Active Management Area for groundwater protection.
	3) Tourism, second-home market have produced highest real estate prices, cost of living in the state. 
	4) Climate change – snow is central to winter recreation and visitation.nQuite similar to Verde Valley/Verde River recreation and conservation interests; quite distinct from Prescott and Prescott Valley (eg in real estate, groundwater considerations).

People want jobs and opportunities, but we feel, as a majority, that our voices are not heard or represented in the state.

"My community is tied together by the residences of friends and family, businesses I like to patronize, familiarity (living at the same address for more than 30 years), proximity to South Mountain Park as a precious community and natural resource and easy access to  transportation (proximity to the light rail, freeway intersections .and the airport).nPlease create districts that are as fair and competitive as possible, given the AZ constitutional criteria.

"As a Sedona resident I have regular needs to travel to the various towns in this area. Fred and I both travel for doctors, specialty and maintenance healthcare to both Flagstaff and Cottonwood. We have friends in these communities, we go there for shopping, dining and other personal services unavailable right in Sedona. The county boundaries have mistakenly separated us for years and we have far more in common with the communities I outlined than with Prescott. Many people work in one place, for example Sedona but live in Flagstaff or Rimrock. n"
"This portion of Phoenix is generally suburban, incorporating many community amenities (shopping, schools, etc.) that are used by residents throughout the drawn shape. There is economic, political, and ethnic variety within the shape but that is good for the community and for competitive elections. nGenerally using natural boundaries of freeways, undeveloped area vs. developed (when and what will happen in undeveloped areas is unknown), substantial differences in housing types and wealth (thus the southern boundary occurring north of Paradise Valley), trying to keep a relatively simple, convex shapes to avoid gerrymandering done to isolate voting communities, trying to keep a generally balanced economic, political, ethnic mix within each district. Trying to keep each District competitive even though that may change election to election. "
"We are new to this area, but have already noticed how this community is tied together by being very proudly rural. Many of our neighbors raise livestock and are proud to live out away from town. Water and the health of the San Pedro River certainly tie this community together as well. While, the Ramsey Canyon area is technically Hereford too, that community seems to identify mostly as part of Sierra Vista and hopefully one day will be annexed as such. Our community out almost in Palominas has a deep love for the Huachuca Mountains and the land they live on. n"
"Marana, Oro Valley, and Casas Adobes have strong community ties.  All three share similar concerns about our neighborhoods and maintaining a healthy balance between development and open spaces.  nOur community, as currently defined by the LD-11 boundaries,  does not define where I live. We have little in common with Maricopa, Saddlebrooke, Casa Grande or Red Rock."
"I live in Marana. Oro Valley and Marana are tied together - without a marker you wouldn’t know when you left one and entered the other. These communities are dense suburban with a mixture of homes, apartments, businesses, parks and churches. They each have large shopping malls and a variety of grocers. The majority of residents own their own homes and speak English. Median incomes are similar ranging from $65-$85,000 annually. There is a balance across age groups. Oro Valley’s median age is about 50 while Marana’s is 40.  There exist strong community ties between the communities, each was established before the 1980’s and I shop in both. Both school systems are rated well above the state average. Both places share the same concerns about clean water availability, ensuring safe neighborhoods and maintaining a healthy balance between development and open spaces.nMarana has little in common with the current places in LD11 that lie in Pinal Co. My neighbors and I have no connection to Maricopa City, Saddlebrook, Arizona City, Casa Grande, Red Rock, Ak-Chin Village, Stanfield, Eloy and Picacho.  LD11 only contains a portion of three of these Pinal County places. Casa Grande is about 21% in LD11 while Eloy is only 2.5% and Picacho is 56%.  Our new boundaries should not be composed of these small community splits which decrease all of the residents’ voices and make it extremely difficult to even identify shared community interests. Residents of Marana and Oro Valley go to downtown Tucson and the University of Arizona for arts and entertainment. Tucson is our central hub while Phoenix is the central hub for many of the places in Pinal County. Marana and Oro Valley are contiguous areas and form a community of interest. Both are located in Pima Co. and share Oracle and I-10 as major thoroughfares."

"Douglas is informed by its strong ties to cross border, bi-national families. I would say this is Douglas’s biggest strength. It’s second strength is the region has better summer weather than Phoenix and Tucson.

Economically, Douglas has limited job availability but it’s cross-border ties seem to keep Douglas populous despite its long-term economic decline. Douglas officials are open about the need to bring in more jobs. The current infrastructure bill being considered in Congress could provide several options: 1) High speed trains in the county could turn this whole region into bed cities for Tucson and Phoenix. A more ambitious project could be a Douglas-to-Las-Vegas route. The county has defunct train routes which could be rebuilt for modern use. 2) The region is windy. An analysis of the feasibility of wind farms, along with environmental impact studies (to avoid harming bird migration patterns) would be beneficial. Regardless, investments in any renewable energy could be useful.nIt’s time to address the historical wrong of the forcible removal of native peoples from Cochise county. An effort to redress this great wrong would need delicacy and transparency but it is critical work."
Region remaining together to retain our common boundaries. Retain rural (non urban) outlook and interests that are highly valued by citizens. Protect tourists interests and our schools from outside interests that do not understand our community values and goals. Continue a cohesiveness of family and culture common to Yavapai County. nWe are people who have chosen to live outside of the urban areas for specific reasons. Cohesiveness of the boundaries would continue to allow those who have chosen and cherish living in a rural community to do so.
"I am a resident of Prescott and Yavapai County and would like the IRC to keep Yavapai County completely together as maps are drawn for the new Legislative and Congressional districts.  We are basically a rural county with values and traditions dating back to the pioneer days of gold mining, cattle ranching, and farming.  The values of the early Arizona settlers are the same values we in Yavapai County hold dear today; self-reliance, integrity, honesty, independence, personal accountability, faith and family, and neighbor helping neighbor.  nWe want to sustain these values and our rural way of life and not compromise them or have them diluted by being combined with urban/metropolitan regions that do not share our values.  I do not want to see our county splintered to make “safe districts” for one political party or another as was done in the previous redistricting.  Our county belongs completely together in one Legislative District.  For the new Congressional District map, Yavapai County should be joined only with other rural counties so our representatives can truly represent our rural interests and not have to serve 2 distinctly different populations as they do today---rural and urban.     
Thank you very much for the opportunity to provide comments to the IRC!"
"Ocotillo Glen is a very diverse community that is bound together by common economic circumstances and community values. English and Spanish are the predominate languages, but respect born from the common experience of immigrants learning to live with new languages helps to bind neighbors with many different mother tongues together. Ocotillo Glen consists of low and moderate income households. The community is multigenerational, including many young families with children and retirees (including  myself) many of whom have lived here for decades. The common values of this area were made very evident to me when I participated in the successful effort to have speed bumps installed on 31st Ave, a residential but through street used by many as a rush hour shortcut. The cooperation among neighbors included those who contributed more than their share to the cost of the project out of empathy for those with greater economic challenges.nThe effort was driven by the common desire to maintain a safe situation for all from small children to seniors. Ocotillo Glen is an example of people living in a neighborhood that is quintessentially a representation of the ""American Dream"" rooted in our immigrant past and striving for a common future."
"The two small Pima County towns of Marana and Oro Valley are filled with a diversity of people many relocating here from all over the United States as well as new immigrant citizens. The boundaries between the towns are not evident  and people travel from one to the other not always noting the difference. 
It is a relatively quiet area and both towns are concerned with the quality of life we enjoy today and want to maintain it for the far distant future. Marana and Oro Valley residents share retail goods and services, water, post offices, libraries, roads, bike routes, and both maintain quality police and fire services. It is not always easy to feel certain where one town ends and the other begins. We are closely linked by geography and common goals of building a strong community where everyone can reach their goals.nWater for the future is a concern."

"Doney Park is a community just outside Flagstaff to the east and very close to Flagstaff City Limits.  It takes me about 7 minutes to arrive at my bank from my home and is about 6 miles.  My gym is 7 minutes away as well.  All of my business and personal needs and that of my family are taken care of in Flagstaff.  Doctors. Dentists , Grocery, Hardware, hair salons, gas stations, mechanics for our vehicles are all in Flagstaff.  Doney Park has many different neighborhoods but we all have much in common as we have larger lots and  are more rural. It is frustrating that we cannot vote in Flagstaff city elections, since so many of our issues are not a priority  as we have no voice. . We also are divided into 2 legislative districts which makes no sense .
Please consider Doney Park, Fort Valley and Flagstaff as one community of interest.  We are one community of interest and want to have the same representation  in state and federal government.nDoney Park / Flagstaff metro have the same  interests as Verde Valley, Sedona, and Grand Canyon communities but would not be a good fit with Prescott from groundwater management to real estate."

Many work remote from home but some still commute 'down the mountain' (Wickenburg / Phx) or 'over the mountain' (Prescott area). Many of us share the same concerns over lack of medical care and services in our area, but also agree that even with challenges to overcome, it's worth living on our beautiful mountain and figuring it out together.

"Most of Santa Cruz County is served by the Santa Cruz River Watershed and I bellieve our political decisions are better when reflective of nature.  The Santa Cruz River Valley and the highlands that surround it are rich with wildlife and wild open spaces.  Because of this, we attract visitors from across the nation and around the world.  I owned and operated a retail business in Patagonia for 14 years; our sales were 15% local, 37% from rest of AZ, 42% from all of the USA, 6% from other countires.

We also care about the City of Tucson and its ability to continue to be a welcoming, multi-cultural, affordable community with a vibrant arts scene and great restaurants. We take pride in the fact that it's one of the most beautiful cities on earth.nIt's important that we continue to be in Congressional District 3 - as we are extremely well represented by Congressman Grijalva.  However, being put into Legislative District 11 has been terrible. Our community is 15 minutes from downtown Tucson and that district goes up to the Pinal County Line. We are not being well represented by LD 11, which is led by people who do not share or protect our interests on any level."
"My COI is Central Yavapai County, which largely coincides with the boundaries of the Prescott AMA (Active Management Area).  We in the Prescott region center on the Quad Cities - Prescott, Prescott Valley, Chino Valley and Dewey-Humboldt which provide the dominate share of goods, services, jobs and housing for our part of the county.  

Prescott was the Territorial Capital and home of Fort Whipple Veterans Hospital.  This historic character, beautiful period neighborhoods, and mountains are much of our tourism draw.

Our area relies on Highways 69, 89 and 89A as our primary arterials.  These are part of the Central Yavapai Metropolitan Planning Organization (CYMPO).  CYMPO oversight stays west of Mingus Mountain.  Our universe is the west side of the Black Hills/Mingus Mountain divide.  The eastern side of the county is the Verde Valley which aligns more closely to Sedona and Flagstaff.  They have the I-17 corridor and the Verde River; we have our state routes and Granite Creek.nHwy 89 A is the route over the mountain that ties our Quad Cities to historic Jerome, Cottonwood and beyond.  The travel time from Prescott to Sedona is about 1.5 hours each way, by way of a windy mountainous route.  People won't do that for doctor, hospital, airport or routine shopping trips.  Yavapai County keeps various offices and staff in the Verde Valley for the very reason that travel times are onerous for routine work if done in Prescott.  

Last, the Prescott AMA is a political and hydrological construct made to help manage our limited water supply.  The AMA is unique to Central Yavapai County and is not a part of the Verde Valley.  It is the subject of much scrutiny and public involvement centered on our side of the mountain.  We are a tight county, and love and respect the uniqueness found on each side of Mingus Mountain."
"Hello, my name is Gary Garcia Snyder ,I live in Yuma County, and I am here today to give you information about my communities well interest.

My community works in agriculture, tourism, government and small businesses across the southern tip of the border. Many people work at government border agencies and others in agriculture , small businesses & hospitals. We are a proud lower to middle  income community that supports each other through family, neighbors and businesses.
My community gathers in Yuma , Welton, Somerton , gadsden and San luis at churches , community parks & centers 
We also gather with others in neighborhoods and non-profit in our cities. We shop from Yuma to San Luis  to Welton and access healthcare at clinics and hospitals in these towns. Our food banks are also in these towns. We use mainly our own transportation to get around , Ycat or Independent  Taxis. There are many parks at which we as yumans visit often.
We have opportunity to travel  Mexico frequently  
nif needed For medical, food , recreation or family.
Last time around my community was split into two different legislative districts. LD13 and LD4 , they should not have been. The previous commission drew districts & weren't compact, did not have equal population, and were too focused on political realms. I pray this won't happen to us again. Arizona Constitution should guide this year , when you are drawing districts lines.  

Please do not include us in a legislative district with Tucson. My community needs to be with other communities designated like us with agriculture and rural. My border towns has concerns about border security same as other counties. We need strong law enforcement for us . We deserve the opportunity to help our local communities out the best way that benefits us as a whole.
I recommend Somerton , gadsden, San Luis  , Welton,  Tacna, roll , Gila bend and buckeye be our LD4 if we do not combine all Yuma County with possible La Paz

"My community is comprised of low income families struggling day to day with low wages, high rates and utility fees with no representation because we are an outlier community. Majority Hispanic that holds dearly to the small school that is tied to a larger district we again, have no input or representation in. We have a solid religious base and hold family very high on our do list. We have an extremely close proximity to Santa Cruz and often share in their outlook on issues. We are wedged between a non-incorporated green valley and the border with Santa Cruz which leaves us on the outside when it comes to legislative, county and community representation. Our voice is being lost and would like to be grouped with a place that has our interests more aligned. n"
"Oro Valley, in northern Pima County is approximately three miles north of the Tucson city limits. It lies between the Catalina and Tortolita mountain ranges. Casas Adobes and the Catalina Foothills are two contiguous areas that should be combined with Oro Valley as a community of interest. Casas Adobes, south of Oro Valley, and the Catalina Foothills, just east of Casa Adobes, are both part of the northern metropolitan area of Tucson.  All 3 places are located in Pima County.  Oro Valley, Casas Adobes, and the Catalina Foothills are contiguous and flow from one to another.  All three places resemble dense suburbia with a mixture of residential dwellings, apartment complexes, businesses, parks, shopping and places of worship. The great majority of the populations own their own homes and speak English.  Oro Valley is home to global bioscience, health care, and hi-tech companies while the populations of Casas Adobes and the Catalina Foothills work in academia or hi-tech companies.nI voted for Prop 106 which established the IRC and I value the work it does. The residents of Oro Valley, Casas Adobes and the Catalina Foothills shop, work, worship and have personal connections across our boundaries. The school systems in the 3 areas are all rated well above the state average. Additionally, all three share the same concerns about clean water availability, ensuring safe neighborhoods and maintaining a healthy balance between development and open spaces. Tucson is our central hub.
The town of Oro Valley has very little in common with the current places in LD11 that are in Pinal County. Maricopa City, Saddlebrook, Arizona City, Casa Grande, Eloy are places my neighbors and I have no connection to.   And in turn those residents have no connection to Oro Valley.  Oro Valley and the Pinal County towns are in different media markets.  Oro Valley residents get their news from the Tucson media market, while Pinal County residents get their news from the Phoenix media market."
"Hi. I live in Clarkdale. No not the Clark’s from Clarkdale, but my ancestors have been in Arizona since the 1750’s. I always wanted to live in  the Verde Valley and the Red Rocks (VV&RR) so I retired here. This valley has been a community for 1000s of  years when 20,000 Sinagua people built their pueblos and farmed. Like them, the VV&RR is unified by our economy. Our livelihoods are based on tourism, retirement and agriculture. Unfortunately most who work in tourism cannot afford to live in the RR so commute from VV locations. Many of the small towns in the area do not have grocery stores, doctors, schools and other services so people have to travel to Cottonwood, Sedona or Camp Verde. The Verde River is one of the last rivers in Arizona that runs year round. We are united in our desire to protect our water and natural beauty so having strong government representation is important. Currently we are divided by legislative and congressional districts which makes it difficult to organize.nI would like our district to be included with the Flagstaff area. Back to the Sinaguas, they also lived in the Flagstaff area. It’s a natural pathway from the valley. In modern times when I17 was constructed it followed that corridor to take cement from Clarkdale to Flagstaff to build Glenn Canyon Dam. However the section from Camp Verde up Copper Canyon wasn’t completed until the 1970s so it was much easier to get to Flagstaff than Prescott. So historically our ties are closer to Flagstaff because of proximity and geography. Our economies are also similar in that we both rely on tourism. Also our area would be better served if the districts were more compact. No matter your political affiliation it is very hard for candidates to campaign in huge, sprawling districts."
"The Sunflower 55+ community, where I live, is currently located in CD1 and LD11, northwest of the City of Tucson on Twin Peaks and Silverbell, a Marana planned development with a Tucson address.  We are considered part of the northwest suburbs of Tucson.  

Our part of Marana is located south of the northern portion of the West Tucson Mountains.  

We have common characteristics with communities northeast of Sunflower near the Catalina Mountains, i.e, Oro Valley (open desert space - yet to be developed - planned developments of single family homes, senior living and multi-family homes with nearby shopping centers, mountains, recreational spaces).  

I encourage the IRC to keep Sunflower and the vicinity of common characteristics and interests – together - as you consider district lines for CD1 and LD11.

"Yuma is located 180 miles from Phoenix, 170 from Avondale, 220 from Prescott, and 240 from Tucson. For decades Redistricting Committees have been slicing and stretching district lines, dividing Yuma County into two parts, and lumping the divided Yuma County together with these remote cities. Although there are plenty of good leaders locally, we often end up with elected officials from the larger communities far away. We are currently represented by a Senator and Congresswoman who rarely come to Yuma.  Yuma County, including Yuma, San Luis, Somerton, Gadsden, and Wellton have very common interests and needs and should have local representation. Representatives and Senators from Phoenix, Tucson, Prescott, or Avondale do not represent us. Redistrict Yuma County together with La Paz County, far west Maricopa and Yavapai Counties, and south Mohave County geographically and per our common needs (water, agriculture, border, etc.) and not by political parties.nI would rather be represented by a member of the other political party who lives, works, sweats, and thrives in my own community than a person from my political party who lives, works, profits, and thrives in a Phoenix, Prescott, or Tucson suburb. They do not represent us. It is time to let us elect our own leaders who represent us."
"Flowing Wells/Amphitheater - while both school districts have distinct characteristics, the last redistricting left both districts divided into multiple legislative/congressional districts. Both districts have much more in common with Oro Valley/Marana than the City of Tucson. While both have large areas within Tucson it would make more sense to have both areas in districts separate from TUSD and the rest of the City of Tucson. Both districts have a long history associated with county/suburban living as opposed to city life.n"
"We are the community of the Verde Valley, Sedona, and Flagstaff.  We have several national monuments, state parks, scenic byways, vineyards, family farms, restaurants, hotels, shopping, art centers, museums, Northern Arizona University and the Northern Arizona Healthcare System.  The tourism industry of Sedona/Flagstaff/Verde Valley draws millions of visitors a year as the gateway to the Grand Canyon. Arizona residents come for the day, and the other half come from out of state or from around the world, and spend several days in our region.  The Sedona/Flagstaff/Verde Valley region employs roughly 20,000 people to support the tourism industry, according to a study by Yavapai College and data from the AZ Dept of Tourism's Flagstaff study.  We share ongoing challenges in common due to tourism; roads, excess traffic, short-term rentals, damage to the environment.  Our goals are attracting tourism, but at the same time teaching visitors to recreate responsibly.nIt is important to keep the Verde Valley, Sedona, and Flagstaff together.  We are united by our tourism economy with business and workers who work in one community and live in nearby.  The tourism economy of Sedona and Flagstaff contribute 2.1 billion dollars annually to Arizona's tourism economy.  According to the AZ Dept of Tourism, Sedona/Flagstaff is the second largest tourism district in the state, only exceeded by Phoenix/Tempe district.  For the vast majority of visitors, we are the gateway to the Grand Canyon.  Our district has successes and challenges that need to be addressed by ONE set of representatives; one US Congressman, 2 State House, and 1 State Senator, rather than having this region separated.   Our district is also defined by the Coconino National Forest.  In my community of interest,  the borders also align similarly with the service area of Northern Arizona Healthcare, which have hospitals and Urgent Care in Cottonwood, Flagstaff, Sedona, and Camp Verde."
"YUMA NEEDS TO BE IN LD3. 
1. The separation of E Yuma makes no sense. My friend and I live 3 min apart, LD3 and LD13. 
2. Every new school in Yuma ESD1 built in 10 yrs is in LD13 because families are moving 8 mi E. Not similar, these are the same people.
3. LD13 is too lg and dissimilar to Yuma.
Large: LD13 stretches N to the border of NV and E to Peoria, a city.

I have worked on campaigns for decades and my neighbors all signed petitions for Congressman Grijalva who I have known since high school when he came to my spanish class to recruit us to join NewStart, a program that allowed us to pick up credits during summer school at the University of Arizona in 1970.  It is imperative that the redistricting commission allow us to have congressinal repreentatives who looks like us and will always represent our interests.  We believe that you will allow us to continue to vote  without hesitation . To do otherwise is disrepectful. Thank you for your time and consideration.nHealth care is a priority during a non-stop pandemic. We need medicare for all and short of a that, a public option. We support migrants and asylum seekers. I personally with 100 other volunteers helped hundreds of DACA students fill out applications at Pueblo High School.  We look forward to police and prosecutorial misconduct reform. It's time to disbar prosecutors all over the country who intentionaly withhold exculpatory evidence to the detriment of innocent brown and black people imprisoned for decades.

We prefer ""small government"" and minimal regulations. n"
"Residents in our community either work locally or commute within the northern Arizona region.nI believe the 2012 redistricting lines  are no longer appropriate due to the marked changes in the population of our state and, perhaps, because the previous commission placed more emphasis competitive districting than it did on the first five other constitutionally mandated criteria.

Populations of CD1 and LD 6 have grown immensely. The result is wide variance in communities of interest, pitting metropolitan values against rural values.
Congressional District 1 is not compact. It extends from rural areas of the far northern border of our state to  the urban suburbs of Phoenix and Tucson, like the original “gerrymandered” districts of the 19th century.

A more appropriate congressional district would include Coconino, Yavapai, Apache, Gila, Graham, Greenlee, and Cochise counties. Legislative district 6 should include Coconino, southern Navajo, southern Apache, Graham, Greenlee Counties, leaving out any parts of Maricopa, or Pima counties, and any part of the city of Sedona."

"I live in the Village of Oak Creek which is connected socially, politically, economically and environmentally with all the other ""below the rim"" small, rural communities of the Verde Valley river drainage including VOC,  Camp Verde, Cottonwood, Cornville, Clarkdale/Jerome, Oak Creek Canyon, Sedona, and Rimrock. Our value system is oriented toward a rural lifestyle (including economic, educational and medical concerns) that has more in common with our neighbors in Prescott and the Quad cities than those to the north ""above the rim"" including Flagstaff/Coconino County which wield a heavy metropolitan and academic (versus grassroots) influence beyond their borders that is contrary to the historic nature of the Verde Valley river communities. The Verde Valley river communities generally exist at elevations thousands feet lower than those to the north, therefore our lifestyles, public safety needs, water consciousness, health practices and educational aims must be addressed differently.n(continued)  Collectively, Verde Valley river communities meet local needs through economic development that is unique to our area. And although tourism is a huge part of that picture, our tourism resources are distinct & synergistic throughout the Valley in ways that simply don't occur with our northern neighbors. Further the Verde River communities are literally bonded by our creeks, streams and rivers and our interests naturally follow that pattern. Our economic makeup (including ranching, small business, industry and more), demographics (e.g. senior and Hispanic populations),  educational and medical needs, and ""traditional Arizona"" character combine for greater affinity with Prescott and and the Quad cities. When considering redistricting, we would be far better represented if ALL Verde Valley River Communities were considered as a unit and if/when combined with another ""community of interest"" that would be with more compatible Prescott/Quad Cities (not Flagstaff/Coconino County)."

"Marana is a town that straddles both sides of Hwy I-10 at the Pinal and Pima County borders.  It is the little town that could.  The council has been intelligent and aggressive in economic development.  It has agriculture, many local and a state park, low income housing, a Ritz Carlton, an outlet mall and a Costco.  The school system is excellent. There are many events that bring the community together.   While the community has a new health center most hospitalization is either in Oro Valley or Tucson.  The police department has joint service agreements with the Pima County Sheriff.  Downtown Tucson and the University of Arizona are the center of our cultural events such as symphonies, plays and ballets.  Our television and newspaper are based in Tucson.nPer the 2011 maps Pima County voters, mainly in Marana and Oro Valley represent only 15.5% of Congressional District 1 which goes all the way to the northern border of Arizona.

It is the central hub of ""northern Arizona,"" and the city and surrounding area are linked by jobs, workers, shopping, healthcare, transportation, the landscape, and more. 

For too long, this legislative district (LD-6) has been gerrymandered to include far distant communities (like the White Mountains and the Verde Valley) that share little in common with the area in order to skew the demographics and overwhelm Flagstaff area voters and residents, which include NAU staff and students, professionals at several large employers, large Native American and Hispanic presence, and a generally younger, more educated population. Increasingly, this has resulted in LD-6 legislators who completely ignore the tens of thousands of constituents in this area."
"The area indicated is characterized by great biodiversity of  species of flora and fauna. Not only do people travel to this area to study and to enjoy the wildlife, but people move here for the same reason. Once here, many choose to participate in groups and organizations to protect the land and it's plant and animal inhabitants.

"This area covers Oro Valley, Marana, Saddlebrook and close by areas.  The common interest is the shopping, recreational and political boundaries.  In this area the residents shop and participate in common social activities. and they have common city governments.  These are all so called ""suburbs"" of Tucson. It is generally accepted that most people travel within 10 too 15 miles of their homes, and therefore this establishes a common interest among the citizens in this boundary.    The prior redistricting was grossly unfair to many residents of Oro Valley which split them off from other residents of Oro Valley and placed them in district 1.nIn the previous redistricting, our area of Oro Valley was included in District 1.  This was unfair and placed our section in a primarily rural district.  The residents of Oro Valley have common interests is their local government, shopping and recreation.  We should not be split apart and included in a huge geographic district with which we have little in common interest other than our common state interests."
"I have no problem with the state legislative districting; I think we are fairly
represented.
On the other hand, our current Congressional districting leaves much to be
desired. The City of Yuma has been divided into two districts and we have little in
common with the other communities in these districts since we are a rural
community and the others are urban.
In my opinion, the City of Yuma needs to be in a single district that includes the
river bordering counties of La Paz and Mohave while also including our local
military bases of Yuma Proving Grounds (YPG), which stretches north into La Paz
County, and Marine Corp Air Station (MCAS) located in the City of Yuma. The
district should then stretch to the east to include the western rural portion of
Maricopa County and Luke AFB. This gives representation for communities with
common interests.

This district would also cover 2 important trans-boundary aquifers and rivers - the Santa Cruz and the San Pedro. Both of these rivers flow south to north, an unusual feature. The aquifers that supply both rivers straddle the border and it's very very important that these issues be addressed together.

"Logically, Catalina Vista neighborhood belongs in the same Legislative District and Congressional District as The University of Arizona and its surrounding neighborhoods as we are an integral part of the campus-neighborhood infrastructure.  Catalina Vista residents include high numbers of faculty, staff, and students as well as business leaders who enjoy walking and biking within and between the neighborhood and the University campus.  I have served on the neighborhood association board since it was founded in 1986 and have lived in the neighborhood since 1975.nChurches, synagogues, and schools are located in close proximity to our neighborhood. For example, Grace St. Paul Episcopal Church is located approximately two blocks south of Catalina Visa on Adams Street.  St Peter & Paul Catholic Church and school are located just one block south of us on Campbell Avenue.  Temple Emanu-El is fairly nearby at 225 N. Country Club.  Many Catalina Vista neighbors are users of these places of worship which we consider integral to our neighborhood environment.  The Arizona Inn, Tucson’s only five-star hotel located on Elm Street a half-block South of Catalina Vista, is also integral to our neighborhood and the Inn owner lives in our neighborhood.

My community in Pima County is distinct from the city of Tucson, and I do not want my community to be included with the city of Tucson in either my Legislative District or my Congressional District.

We are a proud array of families who support each other through churches and volunteering in non-profit community services organizations.  Schools are paramount importance where parents and grandparents support the excellent teachers and staff to prepare our children for citizenship and productive work.

The numerous public parks and recreation facilities, especially the river parkway paths and United States National Forest lands, are important recreation for our families.   In fact, I walk daily along Tanque Verde Creek on the flood-wall path. We often visit public parks along the creek, parks in the foothills north of our house, and drive up into the Santa Catalina Mountains for picnics and camping.  

 In my neighborhood, Tanque Verde Creek is a natural boundary between Pima County on the north side of the creek, and City of Tucson on the south side of the creek.

"Now for the part where I have to be diplomatic. I live in Fredonia. I am not a polygamist, not by a long shot. But anyone that hasn't been hiding under a rock for the past 20 years knows that this area, especially Colorado City and the neighboring towns is where they reside. Aside from that, the area I have mapped out consists of Mormons, farmers and folks that either have lived here their entire life or moved out of the city because they wanted the freedom from the chaos that the cities bring. I think, overall, we are like minded in that we enjoy a simpler life. The area I have mapped contains a vast amount of desert with few towns, a lot of cowboys, horses, cattle and a way of life that few people understand. I hope you will consider my version of the district. Distance prevents me from attending but I have watched your meetings on Webex. Thanks.nI have a love for the Arizona Native Americans. I have worked with them in the past and perhaps understand them better than most. I recently took a trip across the Navajo reservation and one thing became clear during this trip. They are a sovereign nation and every thing that they do and say reflects that. Their way of life means everything to them. I have gone to great lengths to understand and study them. Many times I have listened to their radio station, KTTN, often speaking their native tongue. They have programs that are geared specific to their social and educational needs. I also learned that they have an ambassador to Washington as any foreign country would. Their leader, Mr. Nez, is considered their President and his wife, first lady. We have no business as Caucasians  representing them in Congress. Yet every candidate in the past District 1 is exactly that.
That is why I am suggesting that in my district our Eastern border be on the other side of the Navajo Nation."

"Cochise County is mostly rural, with many interesting historical locations and natural wonders. Water use is an important issue. Out-of-state monied interests are quickly depleting our precious underground water resources and must be curtailed. The San Pedro River, one of the last free-flowing rivers in the Southwest is in deep peril. The wall recently built by the Trump administration that impedes animal movement needs to be remedied. People of color are underrepresented, while white privileged property owners have way too much political control. Corrupt politicians who should be representing the entire population cater to the wealthy and attempt to line their own pockets. The political situation is that way too many voters are manipulated into voting against their own interests and the interests of the environment. The populace is ill-served by the main paper news source with overall poor reporting and monied-interest bias. A number of political leaders discount the needs of many.
nThe current districting favors conservatives and locks Cochise County into policies detrimental to the environment favoring development and the enrichment of developers. There is little chance for educated citizens to counter Trump-supporting Republicans who eagerly accept the misinformation coming from Trump and his allies, including the Big Lie that Trump somehow won the presidential election. We need a redistricting that will allow citizens using fact-based reasoning to help determine the future of our county. We need to reduce the number of those holding political power who are wed to misinformation and outright lies to achieve their own selfish goals. One of the main things needed is the protection of voter rights."
"My community of interest is the entire state of Arizona.nArizona voters are politically fractured and divided.
I believe that at the present time political affiliation is by far the most compelling ""community"".
In my opinion, the greatest service the Independent Redistricting Commission can render is to recognize this fact in its deliberations and to establish voting districts, however odd looking, that are politically balanced.
I suggest that the total number of registered voters in the state in each of three categories -- Democrat, Republican, and Independent -- be divided by the total number of voting districts, and the representative number of voters in each category be assigned to a district.
This would eliminate any one party from having an unfair advantage in any district.

It also includes national forests and other environmental concerns, as well as mining issues which voters would need a say in.nI don't believe anything north of the Cochise County line should be part of LD14 or whatever new district is being created. That is considered more central Arizona which has a completely different look at things. Safford, Morenci, Globe should be part of another district. I think the region should comprise of all of Cochise County and parts of more rural Pima County should be considered. I'm definitely opposed to including any part of Santa Cruz county in this new region. It will affect that county negatively because its smaller. I also think this balances out party wise with a diverse selection of Republican and Democratic voters."

"Tucson is an ancient part of the living world that is unique to the living world. We don’t want to come in and cut everything down, burn everything, sell everything, and misuse this truly wonderful part of our Earth. We need to provide sustainable living, healthcare, and jobs and not just cut taxes for the rich ,which is typical of  the record of the GOP.n"
"Nogales, Patagonia, Tumacacori, Tubac, Green Valley, Sahuarita, southern part of Tucson.  International trade along Interstate 19, beginning with Nogales brings BILLIONS of dollars to Arizona.  The communities are tied together academically through a Bachelors Degree with Pima Community College and the University of Arizona, which are within these boundaries.  This area is diverse in age, socioeconomics, ethnicities, urban, rural and townships.  The Arts and Sports are important parts of family and community participation.  More than half the population is Hispanic, though both English and Spanish are spoken throughout these communities.  The Tucson City Council is an active participant in border strengths, planning and issues.  Cochise County has a history of racism towards Mexicans dating back to the beginning of the 1900's, it is documented in former Arizona Governor and three time Ambassador  Raul Castro's book ""Adversity Is My Angel: The Life and Career of Raul H. Castro"".nGovernor Castro retired in Nogales, Arizona.  One of the reasons was Nogales has a respect for diversity, the Mexican and American cultures, World cultures and find the border to be an asset, not a liability.  I remember the Hannagan trial in Douglas, Arizona where ranchers tortured Mexican.  I was school superintendent in the Douglas schools from 2002-2004 and the School Board did not support advancement of certain ethnic groups of students.  There were also White Supremacist like the Barnett family that went on national television sharing their self-made militias to stop illegal border crossings, which is the job of the Federal government.  The Hispanic people of greater Nogales are very successful and can be found in powerful jobs all over the world.  Children were brought up with at least two languages, and several cultures because of the experience in international settings.  Right now White Supremacy is the United States greatest threat, do not include Nogales with any of them."
"I chose my Community in 1999, for my children, then age 10,12. And my elderly Mother. We purposefully moved to the Sonoran Desert from rural western Montana. From a town of 600-800 people. I came as an RN to TMC. I sought a teaching Hospital work environment and a rural feel with open Recreation at our doorstep, CFSD16School District and virtually crime free neighborhoods. This afforded us our nearby Church, local shopping, expanded shopping up OroValley N, NW.. Several extended family members have bought homes in La Reserve, Marana, Dove Mountain and north to the County line. Much of my life in Tucson has been above River Rd and West, NW above Tangerine. Casa Adobes, Oro Valley MarketPlace Shopping Mall, the Oro Valley Hospital, are all frequented These neighborhoods have been our life. 22 yrs. I meet for club meetings in these areas as well as use Libraries, and Movie Theaters. I have really only gone south of River Rd for official Business or Live Theatre the UofA and Restaurants.n(Unable to manage making the map. Sorry.) I consulted other neighbors for their thoughts on this contribution.

"     Picture Rocks is west of the city and the Tucson Mountains.  Pima County building codes restrict us to one house per acre which preserves the wide-open spaces that I love.
     The community is beautiful.   We get to drive through Saguaro National Park.  We can visit the Arizona Sonoran Desert Museum or the Ironwood National Monument or Tucson Mountain Park.  The Native American Tohono O’odham Reservation is very close by.
     It is very quiet in Picture Rocks.  You might think we are bored, but everyone has an interest in nature.  You can just enjoy the open space and sky or spend all your time outdoors.
     I just want to urge you to draw a map that preserves Picture Rocks as a whole community and does not cut it to pieces in several districts.  Draw a map that is fair and competitive when compared to all the districts in Arizona.  Be fair so that the most basic principle of Democracy, which is the equality of one vote per one person, is not only preserved but celebrated.
nI am an active member of the community and volunteer for a lot of groups.  I can see that our residents are becoming more diverse in terms of racial and socio-economic indicators.  I want every person to be respected for the determination that it takes to participate in our democracy.  That can only be done by drawing maps that are fair and politically competitive.  If not, why would anyone vote?  If people felt that the district map was unfair from the onset, they would have no cause to participate.  "
"I live in Pima county and I encourage the commission to support the re-establishment of at least two Hispanic-majority districts that pull from Southern Arizona.  As a Hispanic community member, I want my district and its representation to reflect my family and my community.  I live on the south side of Tucson and shop at the Spectrum Mall as well as Elcon Mall because I feel connected to this area.  I also feel connected to the areas west and north of the U of A as this is where I attended school and this is where my hospitals are.  Thank you for your consideration.  I hope our voices are heard. n"
"Southern az have similar climate, culture, economics, etcnOther than county, city borders, and natural boundaries like rivers and mountains, no other boundaries or communities should be considered.

"My name is Linda Evans

I live… pressed against the Catalina Mountains in Skyline Country Club at my permanent residence for 28 years. 

My community of interest is geographical, the Catalina Mountain range. Fires, such as last years Bighorn fire, evacuations, wildlife preservation, and open spaces bind me to my neighbors. 

Since 2016 all my representation in government is lopsided. My District Board of Supervisor, my two legislators to the state house, my state senator, and my congressional representative are all from the opposing party, who consistently vote against my beliefs. These officials support the beliefs of people I don’t interact with, who live below another geographical boundary, River Road.

I am highly taxed, a citizen, without representation. No single elected official, not one, not in our County, not to the State, represents my values. This violates my rights given by the Arizona Constitution. I call on you to evoke the Voter Rights Act in my favor.nI am a candidate for the House of Representatives in this great state of Arizona. I am told there is no use in trying, because no one, gets elected from my party in this district. The district as it stands, automatically gives  a 2.5 to 1 ratio against me and my beliefs.

This great county has always been in favor of a two party system. 

There is a solution, Considering population as required by the state constitution, 220,000 people, those of us who share the same communities of interest, surrounding the Catalina Mountain Range, joining in one district.  It is already what exists, our County Supervisor’s, District 2.

Listening to the meetings, the issue of the Rubric as a tool to weight equally the 5 standards given by the State of the Arizona Constitution, was discussed. It wasn’t even on the agenda. It is alarming, an unprecedented use for Redistricting in the Nation. Abandon it. It may draw unwanted law suits. 

 We are humans with feelings, not just another number! Thank you."
"The map of my community reflects where we tend to gather and socialize, and generally speaking is north of the Tucson city limits. This includes BASIS Tucson North, where I attended high school, and Catalina Foothills high school, where most families in the area send their high schoolers, as well as the Jewish Community Center, where I went to preschool and where my family and many of our neighbors go for youth sports, the gym facilities, and community events. 

A major point of pride for my community is our proximity to the Catalina Mountains. The environment here reflects the incredible biodiversity of the Sonoran Desert, and we value policies which are sustainable and protect our natural environment (especially because this area faces extreme wildfire risk, as we saw last summer).

My community tends to travel south into Tucson for work, medical care, and shopping, and I’d say that we have more in common with Tucson residents than we do with communities farther west such as Marana.
nYou’ll notice that my community is completely contained within LD9; I believe that the last cycle of redistricting respected the boundaries of Catalina Foothills, and I ask that the commission do the same this year. It’s a fairly competitive area, as you can tell just from checking out the yard signs during election season. LD9’s current representatives are responsive to our specific needs, which would not be the case if LD9 was extended to include areas farther from the City of Tucson."
"My community is diverse in its demographics: by age, social status, ethnicity, race, political affiliation, etc. It is predominantly suburban in character and seems to be largely middle income with many different types of well-established housing options and businesses. In a sense, it is largely ""built-out"" and has the quality of being self-sustaining by virtue of the mix of housing, businesses, and industry, although many/most of its employed residents likely commute outside of its boundaries to make a living. It includes portions of the towns of Marana and Oro Valley as well as the City of Tucson and unincorporated Pima County.n"
"We live in Oro Valley, residing here for over 40 years. Oro Valley is a close community of 46K people. We have safe schools, great police department, beautiful parks and neighborhoods, and a high standard of living.  Oro Valley is the home to over 10 high tech firms. Although we have a population of retired individuals, we have large population of young professionals with families. We cheer the Wildcats.  We are a predominately conservative area but share many common interests with Pima County, not Eloy, Casa Grande or Maricopa. We shop in Pima County, we live in Pima County, we love our beautiful mountains in Pima County, and we have nothing in common with Pinal or Maricopa Counties.nWe should not be clumped in with Eloy, Casa Grande or Maricopa where we have nothing in common. Even the long miles between communities prevent common interests. Although Saddle Brooke communities are closer, we align ourselves with Pima County and share a common interest. We are NOT Pinal county. LD 11 seemed like a ""throw away"" district made up of all the parts leftover from the previous redistricting plan. Please return us to Pima County where we share a common interest. We want to live in a community that supports the UA Wildcats! Go Cats!"
"This community of interest is based upon values found in open spaces, modified land use to preserve natural areas including grazing and native animal habitats.  We are highly concerned with water use and preservation of the Big Chino Water Basin.  This community has a broad range of socio-economic levels represented; from young families with children to retirees seeking a peaceful and fulfilling life.  So representation in our elected officials should reflect the full spectrum of interests and needs.n"
"I live in the Tucson area.  Most of the people here work, shop, and play in the Tucson area.  From Sahuarita in South to Vail in the East to Marana and Oro Valley in the Northwest.  We are part of the greater Tucson area.  We get the Tucson News.  We are impacted by the same storms.  We belong to the same club, organizations, and churches.  Our kids play each other in sports leagues.    We go to the same parks - city, state, and national parks.  We connected by the Tucson bike trail.  The El Tour de Tucson bike race goes right by my house.  We shop at the same stores like Park Place Mall, Tucson Mall, Foothills Mall, and La Encantada Mall.   You can run into people you know from all over Tucson at these malls.  We go to the same movie theaters.  We watch the same TV Stations and listen to the same radio stations.  I personally have friends throughout the greater Tucson Area.   We are Tucsonans.    We have common interests and lives.  We must be kept in the same Congressional District.nGiven my community (Greater Tucson), I have nothing in common with the rest of Congressional District 1.   My district is gerrymandered from North Tucson to Flagstaff, and the Grand Canyon.  With the majority of it North and East of Phoenix.  We in the greater Tucson Area have nothing in common with the rest of the district.  It takes me 4 hours to driver to Flagstaff and 6 hours to drive to the Grand Canyon, yet only 20 minutes to drive to Tucson which I do every day for work.  My address is Tucson.  I moved to Tucson.  Before the 2010 census, I was in the Tucson Congressional District.  I am now represented by someone who doesn't live anywhere near Tucson (he lives and Sedona) and doesn't understand anything about the Tucson region.   All of the Greater Tucson Area need to be in the same congressional district.  We live in the same community.   We live, shop and play together.  We are Tucsonans. We have common interests and lives.  We must be kept in the same Congressional District."

I have no connection with either the Green Valley area or Yuma.  I am a community organizer, and  work hard to promote the values, sense of community and spirit of Tucson. 
It is important to me, and my community, to continue to be represented by the diverse demographic and commercial community of Tucson.nThe Diamond Bell community in Tucson is currently part of easternmost section of LD4 which has its hub in Yuma. Until the last redistricting, it was included as part of the Tucson community.
These folks canvas with me for Tucson, shop in Tucson and are connected to the Tucson community. They live off of Ajo Highway between Sierrita Mountain Road and Highway 286 at Three Points. They are a 4 hour drive from their current Legislative District in Yuma, and have zero connection to that community or its politics.
The Tucson Diamond Bell community will be better served by redistricting it with its Tucson neighbors."

We are mostly bilingual in Spanish/English. We mostly drive but ride share when we have car trouble and not enough resources to fix things quickly. The summers in phoenix are hard in general, and the heatwaves, rising utilities with being home more have made it more tough but we are getting through.  Because many of us are afraid to be back at work especially without health insurance we trade with one another to make sure we are all fed and housed. Because we are queer, especially for our trans and non-binary family, work instability and discrimination makes our lives even more precarious.

"rural/urban, sparse populations, mountain foothills, ranching, farming

The map I drew would be a community of interest for electing a state representative to appropriately represent the tax paying citizen. For the past ten years i have been placed with the cities of South Tucson and Nogales with which i have nothing in common.  I am diluting the votes of the people who live in these cities. I definitely have nothing in common with the city of Tucson. My Congressional district would be much larger and include Oro Valley and Marana which are very similar to Green Valley and Sahuarita.n"
"I have retired to Green Valley.  The area described will include community interests I have with others in the area. We share interests in shopping, social activities, religious affiliations and healthcare concerns.  The area map includes a population of middle income to middle-upper income persons who largely share these same social, religious and political interests.  We have numerous neighbors who are veterans who rely on Davis-Monthan airbase for shopping and healthcare.  Maintaining DM as a active duty base is a vital concern.  In 10 years I have had only 1 Republican representative in Phoenix.  We share little in social and political interests with persons in most of Santa Cruz County and the city of Tucson.  I believe that this Legislative District map would provide opportunities fair representation for persons with common interests. This map would also maintain and possibly increase Democrat populations of majority-minority areas in Santa Crus County and the city of Tucson.n"
"Empower us. For decades, the representatives from the municipal level, through the county and state, to congress, have served their own or their party's interests, not those of the people in our foothills community.

We wish to show the way for our neighbors in the county and state so we may drive our districts to a better quality of life, a new and thriving era, and a position of exemplary leadership in the state and the country. We wish to take leadership roles in our county, in our State Legislature, and in Congress. To be perfectly clear: We do not share the (expressed) interests of the City of Tucson; our community of interest wants to slough off the encumbrances of the city, county, and legislative governance that holds us back.

Our community is a multicultural community that is predominantly bilingual.  With common interests and concerns over water usage and land usage following the Santa Cruz River corridor.  This community also shares common concerns over international boundary issues and import / export business across the international border.  Our community's diversity is based on the cultural diffusion throughout the designated area.  Where no single ethnic group overpowers any others.  nDividing people based on your ability to win an election should NEVER come into play.  It should be based on the population of the community being served not their political affiliation or race.  Gerrymandering for the purpose of superseding the people's wishes should be abolished.  
"While I live in the Northwest section of Tucson, I have business  ties to other areas like central Tucson.

"My home near  the intersection of Kolb/Sunrise in the Catalina Foothills, provides me close access to a wide range of shopping, dining, businesses, and amenities which have enhanced my life in retirement. My parish of St. Thomas the Apostle  is 6 miles from my home. My community has a notable population of citizens of 55 years and older. Mostly retirees. Easy access to public recreational lands has allowed me to engage with neighbors who not only respect, value and support the use and conservation of public lands, but also believe in protecting our precious environment. Although we technically live in Pima County, living close to the city of Tucson is a huge benefit, because of all the city offers: a university, an airport, cultural and performing arts centers, excellent healthcare with Banner/TMC, UNESCO Designation, diversity in ethnic dinning, diverse neighborhoods, excellent city library system and much more. What's why I view Tucson as an integral part of my community of interest.nI have voted in two other states (California and New Mexico); and was astonished to learn of Arizona’s decision 20 years ago to pass Prop 106 by 12% and create the IRC. Based on my 53 years in voting I’ve come to believe it’s essential to a healthy democracy to create electoral maps which are COMPETITIVE:
1.	First and foremost, competition is an American value.
2.	Our constitution was design to allow voters to elect their candidates and not 
        intended for candidates to select ‘s constituents.  
3.	Arizona’s map should reflect an electorate, which is approximately 1/3 Independent, 
       1/3 Democrat and 1/3 Republican. 
4.	Because of this make up Arizona is a purple state. 
5.	Competitiveness protects us against EXTREMEISM, by compelling candidates to 
        appeal to a more diverse/inclusive electorate.
6.	Competitiveness fosters bipartisanship.
7.	PROOF of Arizona’s competitiveness is reflected in our state-wide offices currently 
    held by 6/Democrats and 7/Republicans."

Some of us (myself included) are employed by companies in Tucson.  Here in Tubac we are also a tourist destination for many in Paima County and the village depends on tourism.

CD 2 spans 4 of AZ 15 counties and is a mix of rural, urban, border town,  and big city.  This doesn’t fall under the communities of interest model.

LD 10 does not fit communities of interest model defined by AZ constitution. The far east side is conservative and professional, the center is blue collar, while the west side of is near U of A, hyper-inflated democrat and densely populated. LD 10 does not have Rep party representation at the state level. In the last 10 years we have had ONE state rep from the Republican Party. He was a fluke and barely lasted one term. Prior to the last redistricting, Pima County had a strong Rep voice at the state legislature; the last commission squelched our voices.ncommunities of interest include veterans from DM AFB and Fort Huachuca, law enforcement/border patrol, retirees, and professionals from Raytheon located here along the Houghton corridor, Corona De Tucson, Sierra Vista, Quail Creek, Sahuarita, Green Valley, and Vail.

Your statutory requirements are to follow the Voting Rights Act, keeping districts equally populated, compact and contiguous, respecting communities of interest, and utilizing geographic features. Once you’ve satisfied those, you can look at competitiveness of the district. This didn’t occur the last time district boundaries were drawn.

This increases civil engagement for everyone."
"We’re tied together geographically, have the same parks issues, and have the same education and law enforcement issues. nCompetitiveness is necessary for LD23. The registration numbers reflecting party registration provide a distinct advantage that reduces competitiveness in LD23. The same has been true in CD6. The lopsidedness of the registration advantage in both LD23 and CD6 has proved to be an advantage for the party with the higher registration numbers, as shown through the decade long inability of another party to win any legislative seat in either district… even despite larger numbers of people voting for a presidential candidate with a different party."
"Scottsdale is part of Arizona Legislative District 23 (LD23).  LD23 is a deeply red, uncompetitive district.  Republicans have a 20 point registration advantage and only about 18% of Independents lean Democrat.  There simply aren't enough votes for a Democrat to win a state House or Senate seat.  A cursory view of the actual vote counts over the last several election cycles confirms this.

CD6 is better, but Republicans' registration advantage is at least 12 points and this, too, is reflected in total vote counts over several election cycles.

LD23 and CD6 need to be more competitive.n"
The main premise of this map is to make the Legislative District 4 part of Tucson and Pima County West and South to be part of Tucson instead of reaching all the way to Yuma. I do not feel represented with current Legislative District 4.n
"I live in the north end of Oro Valley, within LD 11. My community is largely composed of single-family residences, with residents skewed a little older than might be ""average."" We work at the UofA, Raytheon, Caterpillar, and in government within greater Tucson, as well as within the bioscience and aerospace businesses within Oro Valley's Innovation Park. There is a large population of seniors within established residential care facilities. Still, we're getting younger, and our kids go to school here. We live in a lovely value with outstanding views. Our cultural connections may be less defined than those of other communities in Arizona.
I have a somewhat unique perspective; I am the president / CEO of the Greater Oro Valley Chamber of Commerce. While my comments are not intended to represent those of the Chamber, I do believe our business environment is tied closely to our immediate neighbors, and to the communities of Tucson.nCurrently, our district encompasses much of northwest Tucson, to include Oro Valley, Marana, Catalina and the SaddleBrooke communities, then carves its way to include the community of Maricopa. While I'm certain Maricopa is a fine community peopled with excellent citizens, it is more closely tied to Greater Phoenix than it is Greater Tucson. I believe my community would be better represented -- regardless of political party affiliation -- by a legislative district boundary that more closely connects to Northwest Tucson, and in fact reaches into Tucson proper. Currently, and for much of the last decade, the community of Maricopa has had at least 1 of the 3 seats in our district. I have no quarrel with that ... other than the fact they are not our neighbors, they don't see and know us, and their community of influence is the Valley, and not greater Tucson. I'd suspect the people of Maricopa would feel the same way about us!"
"LD23 is uncompetitive legislative district. Republicans have a 20 point registration advantage. Additionally, only about 18% of registered Independents lean Democratic in LD23. The actual vote counts in the last several election cycles prove that competitiveness matters. Without redistricting, the democratic process cannot bear out when a single party is disproportionately at a disadvantage.n"
"Registered Republicans have over a 20% advantage in this area.  There is no competition in races in LD23.  When there is no competition in political races in a district, whether Democrats or Republicans dominate, corruption and illegal activities often follow in the dominate party.  Competition matters and there is no competition in LD23.  The result? a Congressman that has multiple Congressional sanctions against him....and still wins elections.nThis area is concerned about over development, disappearance of natural land areas, lack of public transit and the need for affordable housing."
"Located in the northeast corner of Maricopa County, Legislative District 23 (LD23) covers approximately 1,200 square miles, includes 57 voting precincts and has about 185,000 registered voters.  LD23 is home to the city of Scottsdale, the town of Fountain Hills, Rio Verde and the Ft. McDowell Yavapai Nation.nDue to overwhelming numbers of Republicans and Republican-leaning Independents, it is impossible for Democrats to elect anyone to represent their interests and in fact, the Republicans who speak on behalf of the residents of LD23 refuse to represent Democrats at all. They won't even participate in public forums with Democratic candidates. Please move some boundaries to even out the numbers to give those who are not Republican, a fair chance."
"The most notable commonality of this neighborhood is the lack of water infrastructure, most notably potable water. The Summit neighborhood on the west side of the mine is very distinct from the irrigated green valleys of Sahuarita, mostly because everyone in the neighborhood gets their water trucked in. Many wells in this area are too polluted with arsenic to be usable. There is no transit, it is largely a rural community, at least 10 miles in any direction until you reach the nearest gas station. This seems to be a low income community, with dirt roads and pothole covered paved roads. During the monsoons these neighborhoods can become inaccessible. There are many mobile homes in the area and property values are pretty low. The most urgent need in this community is large-scale water infrastructure investment.n"
"People living in suburban north Phoenix metro area have common interests. Currently  LD1 includes Prescott down to northern Maricopa County in the Phoenix Metro area.

"My neighbors and friends ALL believe in education and education funding. Many worked hard to have the initiatives on the ballot and passed in 2019. 
Our legislators have ignored us and the initiatives.  We are a family community and having Ft Hills in our district has seriously eroded our voices as they oppose any improvement to have even mediocre public education by raising taxes on the wealthy.

I also am disappointed that I have no representation on stopping the proliferation of guns everywhere. One of ""my"" elected officials wanted to make it legal to shoot in your backyard. Noone that I know wants that.
We stand with keeping voting by mail and universal polls for all, registering to vote is enough, don't need extra ID etc etc.  
Please make my Legislative District 23  represent the vast majority of my neighbor families in McCormick Ranch.nThere have been well educated, qualified, serious candidates for AZ senate and house who were hugely popular but no matter how much support they have they can't win. This leaves lots of us to feel we will not be heard. I personally have called on issues and I know that my representatives are not listening to constituents. 
You can help by forming more balanced districts to have less partisan representatives and at least some real debates in the legislature."
"South and Central Scottsdale is very different from the rest of LD 23 and CD 6.  It includes people who are not uber-wealthy, who actually work for a living, many of whom work more than one job.  It includes people living in apartments and condos, who are affected by zoning and other decisions about businesses that are allowed to expand and operate in their neighborhoods, creating parking, traffic and pollution problems. It includes many rental properties and students.  This is the area within LD 23 that has more people of color, people more likely to attend public schools and use public transit, more likely to speak Spanish and other languages,  more Native Americans, and more impacts from freeway traffic.  The effect of combining these voters in an overwhelmingly Republican-dominant district is to make it very difficult for them to elect officials who represent their views.nAlthough the Central and South Scottsdale community,  leans  Democratic, it is lumped in with and swamped by the overwhelmingly Republican registration in LD 23.   1.  In AZ LD23, Republicans have a 20 point registration advantage.  In CD 6 there is a 12 point advantage.  Only about 18% of registered Independents lean Democratic.  This is because these huge districts were drawn to include the very wealthy areas of north Scottsdale, Carefree-Cave Creek, Fountain Hills, parts of North Phoenix, and the surrounding areas.   It is unfair to lock the Central and South Scottsdale community in non-competitive districts where their interests are consistently overwhelmed by Republican and Republican-leaning voters.  Furthermore, the creation of uncompetitive districts undermines the democratic process and our society by reducing or eliminating the incentives to compromise and work for the good of all constituents rather than a partisan and often radical minority."
The community designation as is is acceptable and recommended.  Do not redistrict.n
"Retired business owner; free-market advocate; outdoor enthusiast; advocate for educationnGood governance comes from representation that reflects the demographics and beliefs of the community.  Candidates for public office should succeed or fail based upon the battle of IDEAS, not gerrymandered boundaries.  Gerrymandering tends to result in more extreme legislation whether that extreme be ""liberal"" or ""conservative.""  

Our liberal democracy was designed to govern from the center-left or center right, not from the extremes in either direction.  In short, competitive legislative and congressional districts matter.  This year, they may well matter more than most redistricting years.  The very fabric of our system of government is being shredded by political extremism.  The solution is to have competitive districts.   Competitive districts are most likely to insure that governance is center-left or center-right.

I urge the Commission to create competitive districts that will lead to good governance.  "
"Fountain Hills is basically a microcosm of Scottsdale, except we are more evenly split between parties. We have all kinds of churches, and good schools with a vital young population.

"The ""community"" is in great part populated by upper middle class whites who reside in single family homes.nThe current borders of both CD6 and LD23 make them safe havens for Republican candidates, including many who are undeserving of public office.   Due to past gerrymandering, LD23 has an 18 point Republican advantage with only 18% of independents leaning Democratic, and CD6 has a 12 point Republican advantage.  Both the LD and the CD need to be redrawn to provide an opportunity for Democratic candidates to prevail in elections.  At present, and as demonstrated in past elections, they have had no chance and will continue to have none unless you do something about it."
See additional comments.nThe ultimate goal of an INDEPENDENT redistricting is to draw district boundary lines so the the end result is that future elections are COMPETITIVE. The current LD23 (of which Fountain Hills is a part) give registered Republicans a 20 point registration advantage. This make a run by a highly qualified Democratic candidate an almost insurmountable barrier to being elected. Please aim to level the playing field in this an all districts. Thank you.
"Pima County is a large, diverse and flavorful county. We appreciate our representation that reflects our diverse communities that include two Native American Nations, Davis Monthan Air Force Base, a large, well supported VA hospital and the University of Arizona all of which result in a variety of political opinions, age ranges and ethnicities. My neighborhood is a mix of retired people, working families and young families raising children that attend the local public schools. My adult children attended Pima Community College and the University of AZ. We have relocated from VA and find the diversity of food, entertainment and people in Tucson to be invigorating. We are happy to that we live in a city where all voices are heard and differences are celebrated.   I work in a local public school district and I find the curriculum, teachers and students compare favorably with VA. I hope this commission maintains fair representation across AZ.nI was not able to attend the in person event in Tucson due to previous commitments. I am frustrated in the dearth of advertisement for this important event. Most of the people in the school district I work in are unaware of this important event.

"I’ve lived In AZ LD23 for 6 years now having come from a very diverse and independent district in the city of Chicago.  I feel like I am at a distinct disadvantage of having like minded individuals be elected to represent me in this district.  For those who are responsible for drawing these maps, are you aware that Republicans have a 20 point registration advantage here in LD23? 
There are only about 18% of registered Independents who lean Democratic in LD23. The actual vote counts in the last several election cycles prove that competitiveness matters.  It’s time for all people in this district to have an opportunity to be represented by those with diverse backgrounds and opinions.  That said, I hope that you redraw the LD23 map in such a way that will permit all people fair representation. 
Registration advantages seem to have had a large impact on district lines and that needs to change.nWithout mentioning any names, I was horrified that a far right conspiracy theorist, Covid hoax promoter business man was elected in LD23 to represent me at the state legislature in 2020.  These types of people are dangerous to our community!  This is exactly why LD23 boundaries need to be examined and changed. 
 Also what needs to be addressed is the boundary for Congressional District 6. Republicans have a 12 point registration advantage when electing candidates to the US House of Representatives and that is unfair to all people who reside in this district.  Please take the time to evaluate this as maps are redrawn."
"I am interested in creating a community which values input from disparate voices, and which assists everyone in being represented at the state, local and national level.  I am concerned about issues at each level, from my neighborhood on up, and I am really concerned about vulnerable populations-- seniors, children, persons of color, and those who are financially struggling in our area.  I feel that the state legislature does not adequately address those concerns.  Affordable housing is disappearing in our community, creating issues for people who do not have family wealth, and we have a big problem, too, with food insecurity in our midst.  Concerns about environmental issues, too, are inadequately addressed.nI feel that the current districting makes our district uncompetitive, so that the issues that are important to many are simply not addressed.  I worry that the uncompetitive nature of our district also discourages many people from being more active politically, or even from voting."
"We are bedroom communities to Phoenix. Our community is not competitive with Republicans. Republicans have about 20% registration advantage over Democrats in our community, and less than 15% of registered Independents lean Democratic in elections. It has been this way for many years, proven by actual vote counts.  It is difficult to get registered voters to mail in ballots or to go to the polls. They know that Republicans hold a major competitive advantage. I plead with the commission to even the odds and allow us to to be competitive.n"
"Per your draft map, neither CD2 nor LD14 meet IRC requirements to either represent local interests (here, environment, biodiversity, water conservation, wildfire) or to be adequately competitive. State senators and representatives have been members of just one party during most or all of my residency here. This makes it hard for the other party to recruit candidates and for those candidates to win, even when exceptionally talented and having interests matching those of Portal residents more closely than views of current office holders.  When the latter term out as state senators or representatives, they just (literally) trade positions. Competition encourages bipartisanship and precludes extremism, because politicians must constantly appeal to members of both parties. Please ensure that views of conservationists count in the state legislature and that my district becomes competitive, as required by your regulations. Thank you for the effort you expend on the challenge of redistricting.nI am retiree, who has lived in remote, rural Portal, AZ for 12 years.  I previously taught desert and tropical ecology at the university level and, funded by the the National Science Foundation, the National Geographic Society, and a Guggenheim Fellowship, I conducted original ecological research in Arizona Amazonia and Borneo.  I was attracted to SE Arizona by its remarkable biological diversity, and by a research station run by the AMNH.  Volunteering as a Portal Rescue board member, and as monitor of a community Google Group, has given me intimate knowledge of my town and neighbors. Portal is populated mainly by retired naturalists and professionals (biologists and astronomers, with their own observatories), and our economy is based on natural history tourism.  We grocery shop in Douglas and Tucson, where we also go regularly for medical care, and we share nothing in common with communities in more northern regions of eastern AZ.  We pay higher taxes than our near neighbors."
"The are of South Phoenix (which makes up the communities of Laveen and parts of Buckyeye) has a large community of color which is reflected in the current elected representation at all areas of federal, state, and local government. As a result of this diverse population it is important that the commission respect the right of our community to elect a members of their own choosing is protected in the Voting Rights Act, and the Commission must uphold those protections in the maps that they draft for the next ten years of Arizona's electoral representation. That voting strength should not be diluted.  Referencing the Constitutional mandate of the commission I wish to ask that the commission follow that mandate by at minimum, maintain or expand the number of districts where communities of color have the ability to elect the candidate of their own choosing. nFor the record I  have several concerns that I have regarding the listening tour and hearing schedule put forward by the IRC. 

Community Interest Survey - The Commission shouldn’t cap the deadline for COI survey when Census data won’t be coming in until a couple of days after. The more opportunities the Commission can provide for public input, the better.

Scheduling of hearings - Several hearing locations were cancelled or scheduled at the last minute. This makes it harder for community members to plan to attend and make arrangements. Additionally locations were chosen that made attendance difficult for all members of the community. 

Agenda - There have been inconsistencies with the hearing agenda and COI survey being available in Spanish or other languages at public hearings. 

Community Outreach -  There hasn’t been considerable community outreach to ensure wider attendance at the public hearings."
"Our entire community depends on an excellent public school system, public services, local government, regular communications through our media and among us, public safety, public health and health care networks, and much more or a healthy vibrant community.

2.  Only about 18% of registered Independents lean Democratic in LD23.
3.  The actual vote counts in the last several election cycles prove that competitiveness matters.

If you review the actual vote count in the last few elections, you will see balanced representation matters.   That is not the case at this point in LD23.

This legislative district is some what diverse but has not had a change in party representation because it includes Pinnacle Peak and further north with high income individuals.  Since those voters vote more regularly than the less affluent population, the party preferences are skewed to the right.  I don't think the area is clearly competitive.

"I have lived in this area for over 20 years. An area that is characterized by small farms; local ranchers; pecan, pistachio, and fruit groves, vineyards,  tourism (especially birding) and rural residences is being replaced by big agriculture including a huge dairy farm that grows its own feed. These industries are depleting the valley’s aquifer at more than four times as much water as the natural recharge(2020).  This depletion is causing rural residents to have dry wells causing  them to haul water or redrill expensive wells or move. In addition the ground is sinking and fissures are increasingly effecting public roads.  There is concern about the birds ecosystem. Local authorities have no jurisdiction over groundwater resources unless the state legislature gives them the right.  Our legislative district  has been noncompetitive for at least 10 years and our state legislators have not been responsive to solving this problem.  We need a competitive legislative district.n"

It is, in fact, the AIRC's job ""to oversee the mapping of fair and competitive districts""--the specific language voters read when they passed it.

"I am a lifelong (43 years) resident of Scottsdale. I grow up in south Scottsdale and moved further north when I purchased a home.  This is where I am raising my family. Scottsdale is a unique city, known around the country as a beautiful place to live and visit.  

The city of Scottsdale is currently divided between two state legislative districts and two congressional districts. The large majority is included in LD23/CD6 and a small portion at the south end is included in LD24/CD9. The line dividing the portion of South Scottsdale into two different districts is arbitrary.  The area is very similar in terms of demographics and density. The city of Scottsdale should be included, in its entirety, in a single legislative district and single congressional district.nThank you for your consideration."
"I have lived in this SW Tucson Neighborhood for almost 40 years. While my ethnicity is not Hispanic, many of my neighbors are of this background and Mexican American culture is an important part of what makes this area special with restaurants, parks, and neighborhood centers used by many. I am happy to be in Congressional District 3 and State Legislative District 3 and most of of my neighbors are, I believe.nOf special interest to me is the southern section of Tucson Mountain park which many use to walk for exercise and enjoyment of the desert. My immediate neighborhood is not densely populated and has a rural feel, which we all appreciate."
"I live in a gated community where many of us moved to enjoy outdoor recreation and the beautiful Sonoran Desert. Most of us have moved to North Scottsdale from other states where we raised our kids and pursued our careers. Six years ago, a group of about 80 of us got together to discuss state and local politics. Some of us had volunteered with the Sierra Club AZ or League of Women Voters AZ or the district 23 Democrats or Maricopa County Democrats. As much as we invited candidates for office and speakers knowledgeable about local issues. we never felt any connection to the people elected to represent us. Our state legislators don't bother to have constituent meetings in our area. And even though lots of us volunteer to do voter education in LD 23, which enjoys very high voter turnout, it never seems like a true contest between the Republican candidates (often entrenched incumbents) and the Democratic candidates. Our district has a lopsided voter registration advantage to Republicans.nThat lopsided Republican advantage discourages the efforts of people supporting Democratic candidates, which leads to discouraged/depressed voter turnout, and diminished engagement in local and state politics. 
Districts drawn to be competitive encourage robust participation by all voters who care about public policy, and who appreciate how public policy affects their lives. If the campaign for a seat in state government is not a foregone conclusion, there can be a sincere contest of ideas and voters can choose the candidate who best reflects their values. It's essential to the health of democracy that every voter feels heard, and none feels ignored or taken for granted."

"We are a rural community S of the Town of Maricopa in Pinal County.  We have people from all walks of life, including agriculture, education, manufacturing, and anything else someone can do to earn a living.  Stores are few (there are three in our entire many mile wide community) and we break Nextdoor's metrics because we are so spread out.  We live in the desert and willingly accept our rattlesnake neighbors (okay, we usually relocate or remove them from around our children and pets), tarantula visitors, and even tolerate scorpions, coyotes and other critters, as long as they remain outside and away from our animals.  We have a HUGE abandoned pet population due to city people ""taking their animals to the country to live"" so almost every person out here has at least four dogs and multiple cats--usually inside and out.  Until recently, our roads were dirt and, to be honest, most of us preferred it that way.  nUnfortunately the County has paved our roads and in the process flooded our homes during monsoon rains.  We have no HOA's.  Most homes are on 3 or more acres.  Most people have livestock.  We speak a patchwork of English and Spanish--sometimes in the same home.  We are bound by the 238 on the N, the I-8 on the S, the Haley Hills and Vekol mountains on the W and go from the W side of Stanfield to the Ak-Chin Community and 347.  Along the S and W sides of the Ak-Chin Community N to the 238 and do NOT include any part of the City of Maricopa.  I couldn't get the map tool to work."

It does us no good to trash our community with division.  I've lived in Sonoita for 25 years.  Not everything is perfect but our small county does NOT need to become smaller just to satisfy a few who are unhappy and don't seem to want to work out their differences with others in their community.

"Santa Cruz is a diverse area known for its cattle ranching on the grasslands, birding and biking in the mountains around Patagonia, the wine industry of Sonoita/Elgin, the culture and arts of Tubac and Tumacacori, and the commercial  border crossing of Nogales. The residents of Patagonia are opposed to the mining industry taking over our important biologically diverse area. The local legislators for Patagonia are actively opposed to the Rosemont Mine, while the legislators from Cochise County are on record in support of the mine, and other developments, which would have no negative impact in their district. They do not speak for me! Leave the current legislative district as is.n"
LD23 is an uncompetitive district because of the 20 point Republican advantage. This advantage does not allow for competitiive elections that represent the socio/economic differences in neighborhoods within the district. I would strongly urge the redistricting commission to consider these disparities in determining fair elections.n
"The entirety of Santa Cruz County would be best served as a cohesive congressional district in common with the other Sky Island areas of the Santa Ritas, Patagonias, and Huachuca Mountains. This would align the county interests with their federal representation given the common interests of the unique Sky Islands and borderlands area it encompasses.n"
"Santa Cruz County is unique in Arizona. The culture, the language is different from most of the surrounding area. High Desert gives us a much more pleasant climate. The vast majority of the population is Hispanic (generally bilingual) mixed Anglo/Hispanic families, and English-preference Hispanics (frequently second, third, or even more generations in). Family units are very strong and frequently celebrated. There is a love of music and art. The Produce industry is a major source of revenue. The ""cowboy culture"" of Cochise county is a totally different group of people with totally different interests. Since we often have business in Green Valley/Sahuarita and they often come down our way as well, it makes far more sense to combine these areas as has been done quite successfully for the past 10 years.nWhen I moved to this area in 1999, my representative was from WILLCOX. She was patronizing, condescending and treated me as if I were a child who couldn't understand what was good for me. I know my state representatives and senator and have spoken with them frequently. They represent MY interests and the interests of my community. That should not change."
"In my district, LD23, republicans have a 20 point registration advantage.  About 18% of registered independents lean democratic. The ac vote counts in the last several election cycles proves that competitiveness matters. Republicans are trying to persuade the IRC that registration advantages should have no impact on district lines. Because of this, it is extremely difficult to get Democrats in LD23 elected in the Az legislature.n"
"As an unincorporated area massively expanding in new housing our community is economically similar.  Living in a rural area we use our own transportation for working, shopping, etc.  Our neighbors are families with children, work at Raytheon, government jobs, self-employed, retired Veterans.   Please do not include us in a legislative district with the City of Tucson.nIt seems the last redistricting commission did not adhere to the US Constitution and the US Voting Rights Act as directed by the Arizona Constitution.  It’s critical to adhere to the six criteria laid out in the Constitution to avoid competitiveness which seems to have been the focus of the last commission. 

The AZ Constitution requires that both congressional and state legislative districts be ""contiguous, geographically compact, and respect communities of interest–all to the extent practicable."" 

This is concerning in Southern Arizona where we see districts which could be contiguous representing communities of interest, but are currently deeply divided districts and not wholly representative of communities of interests leaving nearly half our population feeling unrepresented.

The numbers in the districts need to correct the previous maps to be drawn as closely as possible to contain equal population, instead of some districts having 12% more population than other districts."
"We are mostly retired senior citizens who have come here from all parts of the country to enjoy the beauty the area offers…the clean air and water, the welcoming diversity of the community, the opportunities for volunteerism. We may have different points of view but we share them respectfully with each other.nI support the formation of strongly competitive districts that reflect the growing diversity of the people who are now calling Arizona home. By doing so, we will encourage “consensus” candidates who will be forced to appeal to the greatest number of voters, rather than “special interest” candidates who would only need to appeal to a smaller group of primary voters and not be obliged to consider the needs of the entire population of the district.
Arizona has increased its minority populations significantly since the last census, yet these new populations, who have brought their hard work and talents to our state are poorly represented. It is time to take the mandates of the Voting Rights Act to heart and form districts that truly reflect our wonderful “purple” state."

"Urban Senior Citizens living in Mesa and we have nothing in common with Rural areas in Pinal County.nAlso because only a small part of our LD is in Mesa we have a smaller level of influence in the City of Mesa.

"As a resident of Patagonia who has also worked in public health and healthcare in Nogales for 9 years, I can confidently say that my family, neighbors, and coworkers share stronger civic, social, economic, employment, healthcare, and cultural ties to the Tucson and Pima County Region. In order to achieve the goals of competitive districts and representatives who match the make up of their constituents, Santa Cruz County must remain whole and not be divided or lumped together with Cochise County. You can see this playing out during the pandemic, where Santa Cruz County's masking policies, masking practices, vaccination rates, and other pandemic responses have been the absolute polar opposite of Cochise County, and paralleled or been in the lead of Pima county.nAn extremely small but vocal group in the Sonoita/Elgin area harbors negative attitudes toward the majority in the central and western portions of the county such as Patagonia and Nogales. They have allowed these attitudes to turn to resentment of the local governments and politics of our region, developing an artificial affinity to Cochise county. Simply looking at an electoral map can tell you that these attitudes and resentments in no way represent the vast majority of Santa Cruz County residents. There are many people I know in Nogales and Patagonia who rarely or even never travel to Cochise county, but everyone in our region depends on the rest of Santa Cruz County and Tucson to some degree. Many families have jobs, cultural ties, and immediate or extended family in Pima county."
"I live in precinct 75, which is the most southern precinct in LD9, bordering LD 10. The City of Tucson is where I was born and raised, and I am proud to call Tucson my home. I love all the amenities that the city offers, and I am a proud product of the TUSD school district. I also shop in the Catalina's often, and my synagogue is north of River road, in the Catalina's, outside of the city limits. I live in the Palo Verde neighborhood, but I believe that the mid-town Tucson community of interest is broad, and should include areas of both the city and county, similar to the current LD9. I also believe that the Catalina Foothills area has a lot in common with the mid-town Tucson community, as many who live in that area, work in the Tucson metropolitan area. There is also our right as Americans to have fair, and competitive, elections. Anyone seeking to serve in elected office should reach out to the most broad group, and bring everyone together, rather than have non-competitive elections.nDuring the listening tour in Tucson, on Saturday, August 7th, there were many statements made made by residents, not in the City of Tucson, regarding a desire to separate from the city of Tucson, Santa Cruz County, and South Tucson. While many used not-so-subtle dog whistles, one individual plainly said that diversity should not be a factor in the IRC's determination of our new districts. I was appalled by that comment because diversity is what makes this community of Tucson, Pima County, and the state of Arizona great. The demographics across Arizona are changing towards a more diverse populous every year, and will continue to do so. I am disappointment with some of the arguments made by my fellow Arizonans wanting a less diverse community, as such statements are outdated, and hurtful. I do urge the commission to take into consideration the diversity of our great state when creating our new districts."
"The existing precincts of Clay Mine, Cave Creek & Carefree could be drawn as a small COI surrounding the towns of Cave Creek & Carefree. We participate in events in both towns and utilize what services are available. We are a tourist destination.

That said, we go south and southwest for 95% of our shopping, services and many social & recreational activities. This larger COI reflects where we live day-to-day - the area we frequent and consider home. It's where most of our doctors, veterinarians, and healthcare services are. For many, going south of Bell Rd is either a special outing - or a pain in the neck!

The people in this COI live here because we have access to urban amenities if needed yet are able to live and enjoy a more private, semi-rural lifestyle. 

This does mean we share a deep concern re: wildfires. We are always prepared. And our vast horse-loving community helps evacuate each other's animals.nIMPORTANT: THINGS THAT NEED FIXING!

BAD CURRENT DISTRICTING - Our 3 precincts are in CD6 and LD1. As part of LD1 we are grouped with Anthem and Yavapai County, with whom we share ZERO common interests, economics or culture. This is true regardless of party. We DO share much within the COI that I have drawn.

DIVERSITY: The northern third of this COI is comprised of mainly older white, middle class or wealthy, mostly retired or semi-retired people. The southern 2/3s is more diverse in race and ethnicity, younger, actively employed. Many of them come north to work; we in the north go south for services and entertainment.

COMPETITIVENESS: The northern half, or more, of this COI is so non-competitive that we Democrats have had literally NO chance of representation in the entire 17 years that my husband and I have lived here. It's very demoralizing. Fortunately, competitiveness is a constitutional mandate for the Commission. We absolutely need and expect you to make this a priority."

There needs to be balance in maps like this so that the general population feels like their voices and votes actually count for something. There are voices out there right now crying about GOP attempts at Gerrymandering of the new maps; there could be nothing further from the truth.

"You must consider when drawing district lines is that districts are of very nearly equal population. Previous district maps were drawn with 10% more population in one district versus another.  We live in LD6 which includes residents living in 4 of Arizona’s 15 counties and CD1 which includes residents living in 11 of Arizona’s 15 counties, including Maricopa, Pima, and Pinal Counties. Our congressman must travel over 200 miles in CD1 from Sedona to Marana, yet it’s only 15 miles from Sedona to Cottonwood which in is CD4. In LD6, our legislators must travel 170 miles between Sedona and Show Low while Prescott,  which is in LD1, is 100 miles and 90 minutes closer.  Districts should be compact to accurately represent communities of interest who live and work together. That criteria was clearly not followed ten years ago.  The IRC will draw final Legislative and Congressional district lines in a few months, and we Arizonans will live with the IRC’s decisions for the next ten years.n"

My utilities are provided by companies in Tucson. I use Tucson’s public library system, museums, and performing arts centers, symphony, and opera. 

Regardless of those who wish to gerrymander Tucson OUT of the equation; Tucson is in fact an integral part of all the communities of interest in Pima County, from as far North as Oro Valley/Marana to Vail in the East.nAZ's IRC is the gold-standard in redistricting.  Healthy democracies require map which are COMPETITIVE:
1.	Competitive maps protects communities of color and their voice.
2.	Competitive maps ensures voters elect candidates, as opposed to extremist candidates cherry-picking their constituents.  
3.	Competitive maps must reflect the current electorate - approximately 1/3 Independent, 1/3 Democrat and 1/3 Republican. 
4.	Competitive maps must meet all 6 Criteria of Arizona’s Constitution: Article IV, Point 2, Section 1.
5.	Competitive maps are a HUMAN RIGHTS issue,  ensuring the voice of the most vulnerable/underrepresented ( poor communities, communities of color and working families) are protected.
6.	Creating a “The Great White Crescent” LD which would allow special interests to connect Oro Valley/Marana down to Vail, is wrong & noncompliant.

"Prescott, which is in western Yavapai County, is somewhat different from Eastern portion of Yavapai (Verde Valley, Sedona, Cottonwood).  Our 2 areas are separated by Mingus Mountain and Highway17.  So we should be  2 individual communities of interest. 

The community of interest of Prescott, should be included with Prescott Valley, Chino Valley, including Paulden and Dewey-Humbolt, including Mayer. This area is referred to as the Quad City Area. This Quad City area shares the same water management system and healthcare system.

Much of the area is rural, however Prescott and Prescott Valley are less rural. Both have city centers with government offices close together. Prescott’s Courthouse Square, is a popular gathering place for both residents and tourists. It is surrounded by restaurants, bars, art galleries and tourist shops.   Many businesses in Prescott are centered around tourism, including ecotourism

There is also a large population of retired people in Prescott.nImportant issues are sufficient water, uncontrolled development, forest management, inadequate or nonexistent public-transportation. Sufficient water  and uncontrolled development are connected. Many residents feel that our local city government is allowing too much development and our water will very soon be depleted. Also, this uncontrolled development leads to traffic congestion and frequent fatal traffic accidents. There are concerns about the receding water table and more wells in the rural area are going dry. Much of the rural area is covered with forests which are dry and easily ignited by lightning or carelessness, causing extreme forest fires. Since there is no public transportation system, it is difficult for anyone without a vehicle to get around. 

There are 3 colleges in Prescott: Prescott College, Yavapai Community College, and Embry Riddle Aeronautical college. Many students don’t remain in Prescott past their graduation due to lack of affordable housing and good jobs."
"This is a quiet community full of both retirees and families looking to raise their kids in a safe area away from central/downtown Tucson. Many in our community attend evangelical churches nearby. There is a community park that allows families to enjoy fun and safety in a hidden area where homeless cannot overcrowd like they do in the downtown Tucson area. The families in here typically work for the air force base, Raytheon, or another larger Fortune 500 company.
The greater Tucson area (city after Kolb/Pantano) does not represent the community/people East of the Pantano area. Our thoughts/recommendations for the city or our district are not welcome and not listened to.nPlease consider adding the East side to the areas of Tanque Verde or Vail. As mentioned above, our community and our values are not represented by the City of Tucson.

"I live in a community that is north of the city of Tucson and just  outside of the town of Oro Valley. Because Pima County is in charge of the roads, the condition of most of the residential streets is very poor. I think that many of the people who live here are, like me, retired. Although I am relatively new to the neighborhood (7 years), my impression is that most of my neighbors have lived here for a long time.nI live in Congressional District 2, which is a very competitive district, and I like this. Competitive districts make representatives, be they congressional or state, pay attention to the needs and wishes of their constituents. I have lived in other places where this is not so, and my feeling was that the old saying that ""power tends to corrupt, and absolute power tends to corrupt absolutely"" applies. I therefore request that you do your utmost to make most of the congressional and state legislative districts as competitive as possible so that voters are inclined to pay attention and VOTE because the outcome of the election is not a foregone conclusion."
"Small town feel but with some of the big city problems: infrastructure, traffic, land use, etc.  We have a fairly large number of winter visitors with a large impact during the October to May timeframe and since the town doesn't get property tax funds, sales tax and building permits are the major source of income.  A balanced, reasoned representation serves us best, where all ideas are heard and valued. Competitive districts will help elect leaders who truly want to serve the full time town residents.nPlease, no gerrymandering to benefit one party over another.  Districts need to be competitive to provide the best solutions to our problems."

Our rich natural environment draws eco-tourists, especially to the communities of Tubac and Patagonia. Finally, there is Trade: residents of Santa Cruz County shop in Tucson, and Pima County residents are often seen in stores here.

"Anthem is a ""corporation"" with homes, country club, business and services.  We are most economically and socially connected to the city of Phoenix and the northern section of Maricopa County.  Many of us must travel south on Hwy 17 into Phoenix to attend medical appointments, to make major purchases (ie., vehicles, furniture, recreational equipment, etc.) and rely on water, power and other utility services from the Phoenix area.  Part of the Anthem Community literally has water service from Phoenix, and rely on public safety from the Phoenix police department.  Other parts of our community rely o the Maricopa Cy Sheriff's Department for public safety.  We are most closely linked with and associated with Phoenix and Maricopa County, rather than Yavapai County.  The  northern most border for the City of Phoenix is approximately one mile south of the southern border of Anthem.  It makes sense to include Anthem with Phoenix for redistricting purposes.n"
"I am a Mesa resident in LD25, District 9, Precinct 307 (Hohokam park). My current District does not represent me or my neighbors well. Too many different cities are in it that do not compare to each other demographically speaking, and some cities are split up.
I feel that the redistricting should keep my community of interest, Mesa, separate from Phoenix,and Tempe in particular. 
Phoenix voters do not represent the same values of those of us in Mesa. Mesa (imho) is more of a “small town” mentality despite being part of the metro Phoenix area.
Tempe is also completely separate demographically speaking (and community of interest of its own) from Mesa as it is made up mostly of university students and those involved with the University lifestyle.
Mesa is unique in and of itself with the downtown and arts district, and historic district that are INCREDIBLY different than Tempe or Phoenix and need to keep the residents of Mesa as ONE community of interest without splitting it up.nIn drawing your lines, you should keep City boundaries intact. People that live on one side of town (in a particular city in greater phoenix) but work on the other should be in same district so that they can vote at lunch during work and not have to cross the metro to vote and be late to get back to work for example. 
A good divider of “rural areas” if needed would be to use major freeways such as the 17, 10, 8, 40 and even the 93 or 87 if necessary… as long as you do not split a city in using such boundary line unless the city itself is over the population limit of a district – then a common boundary such as a major freeway makes sense.
The main divider for metro areas should be CITY BOUNDARIES - please please do not split a city unless it's population is larger than allowed in a district. That way representatives actually represent their city's residents."

"Pinal County is home to 762 farms and 232,224 irrigated acres of agricultural production, all of which contribute to $2.3 billion of economic impact within the county. Pinal county ranks in the top 2% nationwide in terms of total value of agricultural sales. It’s cotton and milk sales are in the top 1% nationwide, and it’s also in the top 1% nationwide for cattle inventory. It’s alfalfa industry is crucial for supporting the beef and dairy production in the county. Food processing is also a key part of Pinal economy. Food manufacturing provides more than 25% of the county’s manufacturing jobs, with 18% of those coming from dairy alone. Without the proximity of the dairy industry to those processing plants, those jobs and that economic activity wouldn’t exist. We would encourage the commission to consider the economic and social ties within these agriculture-based communities and consider them as communities of interest.nArizona Agriculture generates $23 billion in economic activity in Arizona. Especially in rural communities, agriculture and its supporting industries are the engine of the economy. Agriculture is also part of the history, culture, and identity of the communities that it supports.

The produce industry also supports jobs in processing, manufacturing, box and pallet production, agricultural input sales, and equipment purchases. Agriculture is the main economic driver in Yuma County, and it is the common fiber that unites the community both economically and culturally.

"Cave Creek and Carefree are tied together economically through the Chamber of Commerce. Both are tourist towns, with Cave Creek emphasizing its western heritage and Carefree emphasizing the arts.  My shopping, medical care, and eating at restaurants, however, extends south of these communities into north Phoenix.  Employers in Cave Creek and Carefree are primarily restaurants, bars, small shops, grocers, and coffee houses.  Residents attend churches in the areas south of Cave Creek and Carefree, as well as a few churches in the Cave Creek/Carefree area. Employees come into the community from the Phoenix area due to the cost of living.  The area is a majority white population, with older residents.  Further south there is a more diverse population and a younger age group.  nCurrently, Cave Creek and Carefree are in LD1 with Yavapai County.  We have no connections to Prescott and no coordination with them in choosing candidates for office. LD1 is not competitive and does not reflect the almost equal distribution of Democrats, Republicans and Independents in the state of Arizona.  We have not had the opportunity to choose the candidate of our choice for state or congressional offices.  The Legislative District area should be more diverse ethnically to reflect the population, as there are currently very few diverse members of the population.

"I am a resident of Cave Creek with close ties to Carefree.  These communities lack essential services so I pursue medical, social, cultural and other services in the north Phoenix area between Scottsdale Rd and I-17.  We are not a diverse community with 90 % or greater being of non-hispanic white.  Additionally, the two communities are predominately made up of seniors.

Also,our legislative district is tied to Yavapai County.  We have no reason or desire to be associated with Yavapai County.  We are geographically not connected and we have no common relationships.

For the last 9 years there has not been a competitive balance in our Legislative and Congressional Districts that would provide the opportunity to choose the candidates of my choice.  This does not comply with the competitiveness criteria of the IRC statute.

"Farming communities located along the Colorado River are inextricably connected. Combined, they are home to nearly 300,000 acres of irrigated farmland, and much of that land is irrigated through water diverted from the Colorado River. As users of the same water source, and one that is currently the topic of so much uncertainty, controversy, and discussion, it is critical that these communities be able to speak as one united voice on issues of resource management and economic development. The best way to give these communities that voice is to make sure that the Colorado River Growing Region is considered a community of interest and united within the same Congressional district.nArizona Agriculture generates $23 billion in economic activity in Arizona.

"The Verde Valley Viticulture Area is distinguished by a climate, topography, and soil profile that is ideal for growing some of the world’s finest wine grapes. As a result of the hard work of Arizona’s viticulturists, the VVVA has blossomed into a booming tourist attraction and major economic driver for the state. A 2017 Arizona wine tourism industry report estimated that the VVVA wine industry is responsible for $56 million in economic contribution to the state, including employing more than 640 people. This is a substantial economic driver for Arizona, uniquely located outside of major population centers.

"The map was a little unwieldy to use, but my goal was to create a district including  Sedona/The Village of Oak Creek/ The Verde Valley/ and Flagstaff.  It's important that we remain as one voting block as we live as in one area sharing services with each other regularly and for many on a daily basis.  Many people work in Sedona and live in surrounding areas like Cottonwood, Rimrock, Cornville and the Village.  We certainly shop, and eat in each other's communities.

"I am a registered Democrat in LD 23 and, as such, very frustrated that it is demographically nearly impossible to elect a Democrat into the State's legislature because the district is overwhelmingly dominated by registered Republicans.

And because of that commute we also have a transit system that serves the region.  We share a hospital system between Flagstaff, Cottonwood and Sedona.  Finally because of the nature of the communities and the size of the towns, we shop in each other's towns because you just can't get everything you need in the small towns we call home.

"Hello, 
My name is Ellen Schmidt and I have lived in my community of interest for over 30 years. I currently live in Pima but have lived in Safford. I have worked as an educator in Safford and Thatcher. I do my shopping and recreating in Safford.  
My community of interest includes Pima, Thatcher and Safford. We are an agriculture and mining community. We have small businesses, a small community college and a small tourism industry. 
The mining company Freeport McMoran is a strong contributor to our community providing jobs and educational opportunities by partnering with several local entities. The majority of the population in Thatcher and Pima are Mormons and they constitute a large part of the population in Safford. They control the political, social and economic forces in this community of interest. There is a sizeable number of Hispanics in Safford and Native Americans from the Apache reservation in Bylas visit to shop and recreate.nBeing that we are a community that is dominated by a white majority, I would like the commission to follow its mandate of creating competitive districts and the Voting Acts directive to create districts that give fair voice to minorities. This would indicate that we should be paired with other more diverse communities. 
Arizona’s population is growing and the growth is fueled by increasing numbers of minorities. The map you create should reflect that.  
Thank you for your dedication."
"Diverse urban/suburban population center with a strong community and cultural heritage.
As a community we believe in the value of all people and cultures. Further we place the environment as a priority in governance and the decision making process.nThe redistricting process must maintain fair and competitive districts--which are what Arizonans wanted when they passed Proposition 106 back in 2000. It is, in fact, the AIRC's job ""to oversee the mapping of fair and competitive districts""--the specific language voters read when they passed it. The state is essentially 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 with respect to voter registration.

"We are a rural county with many people who love the simple, small town life. My community gathers in Lake Havasu City, where we socialize at churches, schools and the lake. We shop in Lake Havasu City, Bullhead City and Kingman and access healthcare at clinics and hospitals in those towns. Since we are rural, we mainly use our own transportation to get around. We recreate at Lake Havasu, the Colorado River and the Hualapais. We have our county fair in Kingman. My community works in tourism, healthcare and small businesses that serve the residents drawn here
by our many river and desert activities. In addition to tourists, we also have many winter visitors who spend almost half of their year here enjoying our mild winter weather. So our population grows considerably between about October till March. Although those visitors spend a long period of time here and contribute to our communities while they are here, they are residents of other States and Canada. nLast time around my community's Congressional district was stretched out to grab areas above and past Phoenix. Our district was not compact and did not focus on communities of interest. I want to see more emphasis put on maintaining compact districts made up of communities of interest. By scooping up areas north and east of Phoenix into our district, the district did not respect the communities of interest in those areas either. The Arizona

"The greater Sierra Vista/Fort Huachuca and Cochise County community has a multilingual population covering the gamut of many diverse languages. Protection of our resources such as the San Pedro Riparian area and water conservation are high on the list. Our current political boundaries prevent a cohesive support for the betterment of our community. Education has always been a hot topic and within our current district we have been stymied by our citizens in the engorged Phoenix area. 
Our cultural bond with our partner to the south has been curtailed because of COVID. Leadership in our capitol has to date been ineffective in controlling the uptick in the viral activity throughout our state.  Improvements in the border towns such as Douglas and Naco must be addressed as they are not only a lifeline for our community but the greater community of Arizona.nWe have a shared history with our Mexican neighbors to the south. Remember that the US purchased a big chunk of Mexican territory (Gadsden Purchase) thus many in our community that are Spanish speaking and underrepresented need to be addressed in this map redrawing effort.
Fort Huachuca is a major driver of economic action in our community and thus need to be included in any maps that are being proposed. The Fort is tied to the City of Sierra Vista and the interdependence must also be considered.

We are more concerned with small America than large.   Our churches, businesses, rv’s and camps, and especially our rodeos all direct to small family unites far more than large city areas.    In turn for moving Wickenburg to Yavapai, Anthem is by far a better fit to Maricopa as it’s big businesses dictate.    We have only small mom n pop shops with proudly no big box.

"Fountain Hills is a unique community. We are bordered by nature which provides the greatest draw for residents, who deeply appreciate all that this town offers: Breathtaking views, along with healthcare facilities, along with civic, religious and social amenities.  

If it weren't for the nasty politics, brought to the forefront by a number of unprofessional individuals, we would enjoy equal representation, but alas, the AZ Leg remains unbalanced!  It is like pulling teeth to elect a reasonable, popular LD23 Democratic candidate to the AZ House.nYes, we are INDEED tied together. Here in FH, generally speaking, what is good for some is good for all.

"Other than physical location, it's  difficult to give an accurate description of the citizens of the Verde Valley. The main employers are Northern Az. Health Care, Yavapai College, the Cement Plant; thus, jobs can range from unskilled/skilled labor to employees with spedific highly paid professions to providers of higher education. 
The population is mainly white - followed by Latinos and Native American - and many are middle aged or senior citizens; therefore, social and civic networks and public transit are issues of concern. English, Spanish, and Yavapai/Apache can all be heard.
It is still rural and and to some degree may be considered very much in the Old West tradition.  The population density is increasing with only a limited increase in basic social services.
Rodeos and some Native American ceremonies are events of common interest. The Verde River and its parks are also a unifying source of recreation and business. as well as sources of environmental concern. nIt seems most difficult to provide a map that meets the required criteria. A community of interest can be outlined. However, it is a challenge to draw a map that represents an equal population, protects and enhances communities, is compact and contiguous, and is fair.  To draw a map, even one that goes way beyond the boundaries of the Verde Valley. that comes close to being competitive seems very very difficult. 
Hopefully, the Commission will have the data from the 2020 Census and that will help solve the problems. It would be very important and most encouraging to think that candidates of all parties have an even playing field. Thank you all and I look forward to your reports."

Most are hardworking and expect the same from their legislators. We expect and need a healthy, safe and thriving environment in which to work, go to school, worship, and create. We need fair and clean elections, as we have had for the last 10 years with the IRC.nVoting rights in AZ are in peril of being undermined by a small majority of legislators, who are not representing the people, but fiercely attempting to retain power, while undermining Democracy. Arizona has been better than that, and the people who live and work here deserve better. We need to retain a fair and balanced IRC."
"I moved to Arizona in 1984 as a child. I have seen this Valley grow and change significantly in the past 36 years. One of the things that has always amazed me is how, even though neighborhoods and cities blend together, each area of the Valley has a distinct vibe. I have lived in many of these areas from one time or another, and for specific reasons. For example, when I was younger, I wanted to be close to the downtown areas of Tempe and Scottsdale. Now that I have a family, my choice of neighborhood is determined by schools and what a neighborhood has to offer my son.

We spend our time primarily in the southeast Valley in the communities of Mesa, Queen Creek, and Gilbert. Our church is in Gilbert, I work near the 202/Hwy 60, and we live in Eastmark. My son goes to American Leadership Academy in Mesa. We enjoy going to the Salt River on weekends, and to restaurants in downtown Gilbert.nI have good friends who live in great neighborhoods around the greater Phoenix area. But their neighborhoods are not for me, nor is my neighborhood a fit for their preferences.

Please be respectful of these preferences when drawing legislative district lines. Keep communities together and recognize that we can be more effective citizens when we are working with our neighbors.

Respectfully,
Kimberly Miller"
"South-Central Scottsdale: medium-income and working class neighborhoods tied together economically with the local retail and service businesses. These people are not well represented by a party-line voting, low visibility Tea-Party style candidate.nIn the 2020 election in CD6, with an incumbent Republican candidate (D. Schweikert) having been found guilty of ethics violations and identified as one of the state's two weakest national representatives by the leading local conservative newspaper columnist, the incumbent won by a large margin against a strong, centrist candidate. This is surely a sign that CD6 is not competitive."
"My name is Jim Staffnik.  I live in Concho, Apache County. Concho is a small community in southern Apache county that borders the western Navajo/Apache county line.  The communities in southern Apache and Navajo counties play one another in sports; the communities are bound together by both familial and religious ties.  Shopping, medical care, movie going, dining are all area-wide.  For example, my children attended school in St Johns. We go to church, shop and train our dogs in Show Low. We belong to the Apache County Sheriff’s Posse. I work for Navajo County in three Apache County school districts.  My situation is not unique.

Legislative District 7 (LD 7) splits the communities of Gila, Navajo, Apache, Yavapai and Coconino Counties.

Concho, St. Johns, Springerville, Eagar, Show Low, and Pinetop/Lakeside have few if any communities of interest with the Reservation communities.nSt. Johns, Round Valley, Show Low, Pinetop/Lakeside, Vernon, Greer and Alpine are with the Reservation in LD 7.  Snowflake/Taylor, Heber-Overgaard, Payson, Camp Verde, Sedona and Williams are in LD8.

LD lines should be redrawn so as to preserve communities of interest by doing the following:  Combine the Reservation portions of Navajo, Apache, and Coconino Counties with Flagstaff to make a legislative district.  Next, combine the non-Reservation portions of Apache and Navajo Counties with Gila, Greenlee, Graham, and portions of Coconino County.

Congressional District 1 (CD1) is a hodgepodge of very diverse counties and communities.  Apache, Navajo, Greenlee, Graham, part of Gila, part of Pinal, Coconino, part of Mohave and part of Pima are combined with the with the Navajo Reservation.

CD lines should be redrawn so as to preserve communities of interest by doing the following:  Combine all of Yavapai, Coconino, Gila, Navajo, Apache, Graham, Greenlee and Cochise counties."
"I am here this evening to talk about Flagstaff as a “community of interest”.  My name is Nancy Branham and my husband, Frank, and I have lived in Flagstaff for over 30 years.  We are both involved members of the community and love living in Flagstaff.  I have been a licensed REALTOR for 30 years. In addition to my career as a successful real estate professional, Frank and I owned one of Flagstaff’s iconic restaurants, The Cottage Place, for over 22 years.  That gave us a perspective on both our tourism industry and the ups and downs of owning a business in a small town.  Volunteer work has also been a mainstay for me.

My life and time in Flagstaff is living proof that we are truly a community of interest.  Surrounded by public lands we ARE very definitely a geographic area with shared interests; cultural, historic and economic.nMuch of our state is rural, including much of the land contiguous with Flagstaff.  Flagstaff is what holds our region together and it must be kept whole.  We are not like Maricopa County. . . we have ONE hospital, ONE university, ONE mall, ONE car dealership for each kind of car, ONE school district, ONE airport, ONE symphony, ONE historical museum.  But you get the idea; Flagstaff is a community where we live and do EVERYTHING and the surrounding smaller communities including Kachina, Mountainaire, Forest Highlands, Munds Park, Morman Lake, Bellemont, Doney Park, Parks, Grand Canyon and Tuysayan also come here to dine, shop, work, recreate and be entertained.  
I sincerely thank each of you for taking on the task of redistricting and know that you will use the six constitutionally mandated criteria to guide your work. 
Please take my words to heart and make sure Flagstaff and the surrounding communities are kept together in the redistricting process!"

"When I moved to the Parks Community area, there were not very many people living here in an area that was (and still is) forested and dotted with prairies.  Many came for the love of being close to nature but sadly, with fencing etc., there is not the game we used to see wandering around.  Others came for the lack of oversight. 
The ""downtown"" area consisted of a small general store with gas station, which housed the Post Office.  There was a small school associated with the Flagstaff School system, where I taught K-6 grades for some years.  
We live out on a prairie, near a national forest.
Throughout the years population spread out into our prairies and forests.  The community acquired another general store, a larger school and a sometime restaurant. 
However, we remain a rural community, mostly white, and are now pretty much a bedroom community.   There is, for the most part, very little diversity in the area.n"
"I spoke on August 8th.

My name is Eric Nielsen and I reside in CD-2 / LD-10.  I'm a 28 year resident of Arizona, all in Tucson.

My community of interest is with all those speaking in favor of competitive districts.  

I am happy to live in one of America's most competitive Congressional Districts, one that has repeatedly flipped between Democrats and Republicans in its relatively short history. 

Others may disagree but I believe competitive districts encourage more moderate voices and high voter turnout.  I applaud on both counts. 

The AZ Supreme Court ruled that all redistricting criteria be weighed equally.  Competiveness is no less important.  I strongly encourage you to draw districts that are both competitive and reflective of communities of interest.  This won't be easy.  Fitting some 800,000 people into each CD when 68% of the state population lies in Maricopa County and 1/3 of voters are neither Republican nor Democrat is a tall order. 

Your service is appreciated.n"
"We have submitted comments on the growing regions within the Gila Valley and Cochise County separately. However, these regions combined represent an area of the state critically important to agricultural production. Not only does this region have the appropriate climate and geography to produce diverse and highly valuable agricultural commodities, it also fuels the inputs necessary for other ag operations such as hay and silage for dairy and feeding operations throughout the state. It is also home to numerous cattle ranching operations that account for 10’s of millions of dollars in sales. As a major economic driver for these communities, agriculture is inextricably tied to the communities and the people who live there. We would encourage the commission to consider the economic and social ties within these agriculture-based communities and consider them as communities of interest.nArizona Agriculture generates $23 billion in economic activity in Arizona. Especially in rural communities, agriculture and its supporting industries are the engine of the economy. Agriculture is also part of the history, culture, and identity of the communities that it supports. In light of the crucial role that agriculture plays in our state’s rural areas, we encourage the Independent Redistricting Commission to treat key agriculture production regions of the state as communities of interest and avoid splitting the communities in these areas along arbitrary lines. These agricultural communities represent areas of common economic and social bonds and should be designated in the same legislative districts."

"My name is Tim Faulkner.  My wife and I live in Elgin (Santa Cruz County), AZ.  I am retired and enjoying life's offerings.  I am participating in this process to help preserve what we have been blessed with here in AZ.

About this area:  Native Indians, composed by many tribes, were the original settlers; next the Spanish explorers followed the Jesuit priests and Mexican Vaqueros; later Americans from the eastern US came in search of riches, a new life and opportunities.  Ranching, mining and railways helped develop many towns throughout this area.  The border town of Douglas serves as port of entry to those entering the US.  Tourism links the area in historic towns of Tombstone, Wilcox, Benson, Bisbee, Sonoita, and Patagonia.  Visitors frequent the wine regions of Wilcox, Sonoita and Elgin to partake of its fine wines.  Natural beauties of the Chiricahua's, Kartchner Caverns, San Pedro River and many mountain ranges, along with the diversity of its fauna & flora draws visitors here.nThe community I live in Sonoita-Elgin, would greatly benefit by being represented by legislators who actually share our values & that will engage in our community by listening to our voices, addressing any issues & providing support.  The common thread of the people here cherish their freedoms & quality of life that a rural lifestyle offers.

Items to Consider:
- Do not mix urban with rural
- The proposed LD should consider having its map drawn (all/part) from rural counties of Cochise & Santa Cruz and rural outskirts of eastern & southern Pima county (outside Tucson city limits)
- Having wine regions of Wilcox, Elgin-Sonoita in same LD would be beneficial
- In separate LD place Nogales using portions of SC & Pima counties.  Keep this LD free from areas within Tucson city limits.  Residents of Nogales are more familiar & connected to regions along 19 Interstate (areas of which they most likely work/shop & conduct business
- Tucson LDs shld be composed using areas within city boundaries"

To be impartial you must disclose and report during an open, public meetings.

"I am a retiree living in Portal since 1992 after my retirement from 27 years as an elementary school teacher in Tempe, AZ.  I came to Portal because of my love of nature: I have been a volunteer in many community activities. I know my community well. I have not felt I had a state representative or senator who I could write to or who understood the important values of my community which include water conservation, and environmentalism with economy based on tourism and natural history and now fire as Portal is in the Coronado Nat. Forest.  I want the new district to be strongly competitive so my values have a fair chance. LD14 state legislators have not represented IRC requirements for local interest or competitiveness.  Our previous elected state officials have been members of the same political party for many elections. They just trade positions when they term out.  We need competition, we need bipartisanship, someone in office who cares about the citizens for whom s/he represents.nCompetition in elections encourages bipartisanship to appeal to many people. We have had difficulty recruiting candidates from our losing party, and even though our candidates have been excellent, they can’t seem to win."
"Our community in Patagonia is most proximate to the communities of Sonoita and Elgin, with whom we have close relations.  We are rural and progressive and self-reliant.  Our Fire Departments work together to deter significant threats to the rural environment that determines our shared lifestyle.  In fact, it is our shared strong connections with the natural environment, generally not in favor of dramatic development, that gives us pride in our homes and communities and lifestyles.  We are all Santa Cruz County, all the way.  Please leave it that way.nIn Patagonia, our closest relations are with Sonita and Elgin.  They like we have few if any regular relations with Cochise County or its sadly commercialized ""urban"" centers, Huachuca -- essentially, a military base -- and Sierra Vista, AZ.  On the contrary, relations between our largely pastoral towns and Sierra Vista are few and thin.  Merging Sonoita's and Elgin's legislative and congressional districts with districts in Cochise County defies long-standing, even historic shared traditions, community relations, and positions on public issues, those current and those we can foresee.  Unless the IRC has as its hidden agenda destroying the comity of our corner of Santa Cruz County, it should dispose completely of the notion that a handful of opportunists out to exploit redistricting for their own benefits, whatever those may be, represent thinking in these parts.  They don't.  Keep things as they are and permit us collectively to choose with whom we wish to affiliate.  Thank you."

"Eco-tourism:  Keep Santa Cruz County together and link it via the I-19 corridor to Tucson.  Tourists to this area are drawn by events such as Tubac Arts Festival or the wine festivals in the Sonoita/Elgin area, but our rich natural environment draws eco-tourists, too.   The birds and wildlife that entice visitors depend on a healthy habitat, and the mountains to the east and west of the I-19 corridor provide it.  
Please do not separate Santa Cruz County into different districts and especially do not combine us with Cochise County.  Cochise has a history of electing lawmakers who prioritize development over ecosystem services.   That alone will create much ill-will in this county, threaten the ecosystem that was the reason many of us moved here, and destroy the health of a critical US habitat and migratory corridor.nI submitted something along these lines over a week ago, but I can't find it on the IRC website.  I looked through all the comments and all the maps.  
Please use this one even if the other one turns up, if that's possible.

"I voted for Prop 106 which established the IRC and I value the work it does. The residents of Oro Valley, Casas Adobes and the Catalina Foothills shop, work, worship and have personal connections across our boundaries. The school systems in the 3 areas are all rated well above the state average. Additionally, all three share the same concerns about clean water availability, ensuring safe neighborhoods and maintaining a healthy balance between development and open spaces. Tucson is our central hub.

The town of Oro Valley has very little in common with the current places in LD11 that are in Pinal County. Maricopa City, Saddlebrook, Arizona City, Casa Grande, Eloy are places my neighbors and I have no connection to. And in turn those residents have no connection to Oro Valley.

"I'm a native Tucsonan born at Tucson Medical Center, I have lived most of my life in District 2. When I was about 6 years old my parents built a house in Central Tucson, I purchased my own home in Central Tucson 41 years ago. One thing I love about Tucson is the diversity of the population which I see even in my own neighborhood. District 2 includes the UArizona as well as many restaurants, schools, movie theaters, the Botanical Gardens and other wonderful areas that allow us to spend time together and outdoors.

District 2 has always been well represented, I would not like to see that changed. I am also concerned for the people in the more rural areas or people of color who may feel their voices will be lost if there are changes to the district boundaries. 
As Tucsonans our lives are intertwined and I love that about my city. Even though we are the 2nd largest city in AZ our community feels relaxed like that old comfortable pair of jeans you hate to wash.nDistrict 2 is located in the southeastern corner of the AZ includes roughly two-thirds of Tucson. It is the only one of the state's nine congressional districts that does not include any part of Maricopa County. It's 89% urban, 11% rural, pop 733,197,  median household income of $54,833.

 In Cochise County there is the US Army base Fort Huachuca & numerous military-industrial companies. Southeast AZ is an ecological crossroads where habitats & species from the Sierra Madre of Mexico, the Rocky Mountains, the Sonoran & Chihuahuan Desert can be home to unique habitats harboring rare species, plants & animals. Our glorious deserts & mountain ranges provide us beautiful areas to hike, picnic, camp, spend time with our families &  friends. Our congressional representation has always respected these areas & have vowed to keep them protected. 

CD2 is a competitive district. It is important to keep it competitive and ensure it's growing communities of color remain represented.

"I have friendships all over the valley, especially Northern Maricopa. My world of healthcare, shopping, dining and entertainment extends mainly from Carefree and Cave Creek along the Scottsdale, Tatum and Cave Creek Road corridors down to Shea Blvd, sometimes even as far as Camelback Road. I also enjoy photographing and sightseeing in North Valley parks. Common interests with friends are enjoying the natural landscape and dining out at small, family-owned restaurants. Concerns include sustainable resources, especially water, suburban sprawl and wild fires. I look forward to extending our district south and slightly west to gain more diversity in age and ethnicity since our area is mainly populated by white seniors. Cultural and ethnic diversity is important to me since I have lived abroad and in New York City. My community of interest does NOT extend north into Yavapai County or to Prescott, the political power center of LD1.nMoreover, lawmakers in Prescott do not represent my interests. They cater to extremists--Oath Keepers and conspiracy mongers and ignore my concerns of sustainable development, Covid remediation, quality education and guarding the environment. The district has been uncompetitive for over 20 years which has ensured one party rule and the impossibility of qualified candidates from other parties from wining. I recommend that my district run south and slightly west rather than north. I also believe the Commission should follow the mandate set forth in Prop 106 of creating fair and competitive districts. That way my community's interests and Arizona's future would be better served."
"The above area comprises the Kyrene School District. It's of upmost importance to our children that community input on educational and budgetary issues is consolidated. School Board members are elected from this area and to break it up would cause confusion and limit candidate selection and representation.nIn the past decade, there has been a dramatic increase in teen suicides in our area. Our elected State Representatives, in conjunction with members of the Kyrene School Board, and Kyrene School Administrators have initiated data based programs to increase social and emotional support for our children.

While each community is unique, the hub of Flagstaff for services and economic opportunity is a unifying thread in each. For all of that, Flagstaff has been in a legislative district that has not offered it representation (per how it has voted) even once over the last decade. Keep Flagstaff and it's surrounding communities whole, and offer us a fair chance at representation.n"

"My LD10 community is a wonderful melange of people from diverse backgrounds and economic groups that believe in similar values. I moved to Tucson from Phoenix four years ago, knowing few people. Over time I have met many new friends in my neighborhood and beyond who have enriched my life. I value their differences and am happy that Tucson is my home. Over the past decade, both Democrats and Republicans have been elected to federal, state and county offices in LD10. My district is truly a fair and competitive district. I want it to stay as it is. Only by having fair and competitive maps can we protect against extremism and one-party rule. Our districts across Arizona must reflect the reality that Arizona's population is changing. Fair and competitive maps cannot happen with gerrymandering.n"
"I have attempted to draw my Community to include the Catalina Foothills from I-10 to Kolb and from north of Ina south beyond River Rd to Speedway in order to include at least part of the City of Tucson.  This Community encompasses where we live, shop, dine, and exercise.  Including parts of the City of Tucson make us culturally and ethnically diverse.  It also means the COI is Competitive, comprising voters registered with major parties, minor parties, and Independents.  That results in representatives and candidates that need to appeal to and speak for many points of view.  It makes it less likely the candidates embracing extreme positions will be elected.  I was very troubled by some of the testimony I heard on 8/7/21 opposing Competitiveness, which is one of the criteria guiding the IRC in drawing our districts.  For me, Competitiveness is the most important criterion because without it elections become mere coronations of the dominant party.  We lose our choice and our voice.nPlease don't dilute the Competitiveness we have now in our districts by excluding parts of the City of Tucson. I heard many speakers urging the Commissioners to keep the communities north of River Rd separate from the City of Tucson because they disagreed with some Tucson politicians. I too often disagree with Tucson City actions.  But that's the nature of living in a democratic society. We disagree, we try to elect people we agree with, but we respect other points of view. Arizona has become blessedly more politically as well as demographically diverse (30/30/30 voter registration) while still keeping our SW style, character and sensibility. Your difficult but critical job is to find and keep a balance. That's why we voted for Independent Redistricting in the first place. No gerrymandering to guarantee either party a win every time and deprive non-majority voters any chance of electing representatives to speak for them. Thank you for your courage, time and energy to serve on the IRC."
"The residents of Marana, Oro Valley, Catalina, Eagle Crest, Saddle Brooke, and Saddle Brooke Ranch live outside the Tucson city limits to enjoy more open space for homes, shopping and businesses.  Residents use churches, businesses, healthcare within each others communities, nullifying the need to travel to the City of Tucson.  The language spoken in these areas is predominately English and many settle in these communities from all over the country, whereas residents of Tucson, are generally natives.   This broadens the differences is priorities for City of Tucson vs the Northwest Pima County residents.nI respect the willingness of the IRC committee to volunteer for such an important non-paying job to bring back confidence to the citizens/voters of Arizona and bring them back to the polls.   Meeting the goals of Ariz. Const. art. IV, pt. 2, section 1(14) is challenging but necessary to begin restoring some level of voter confidence.  

Some things that were highlighted during the 8/8/2021 IRC hearing that appear to need resolution this time around are: 

- Districts shall be geographically compact and contiguous to the extent practicable;
- District boundaries shall respect communities of interest to the extent practicable;

and most importantly: 

- To the extent practicable, competitive districts should be favored where to do so 
would create no significant detriment to the other goals"
"The Sunnyslope Community has long been unique to Arizona, serving as its own township for many years before being incorporated into Phoenix. Because of that uniqueness, the population there should not be split up in maps, as has happened in the past. The community is not just separated by Interstate 17, as the socioeconomic and neighborhood realities of that geographic area expand both West and East of the Interstate. Please keep Sunnyslope in tact and together.
Moreover, I am asking that the IRC extend the deadline for the community of interest survey. That would provide many of the community members in the Sunnyslope region to attend the hearings. 
To add to that, the Commission shouldn’t cap the deadline for COI survey when Census data won’t be coming in until a couple of days after. The more opportunities the Commission can provide for public input, the better.nThere also hasn’t been considerable community outreach to ensure wider attendance
at the public hearings.
● The Commission still has no Community Outreach Coordinator dedicated
to this work.
● There was no press in Spanish-language media outlets announcing the
hearings.
● The hearings were only announced via media alerts and on the IRC
website. There didn’t seem to be attempts to increase public engagement
by alerting other community organizations or community outlets."
"The eastern part of Tucson, including a diversity of neighborhoods, developments, commercial spaces and natural resources (parks, recreation areas, the Loop, etc.) is a suburban-type area and a logical extension of the development that reached out easterly as Tucson grew in the 40's through the 70's.  Housing is reasonably priced, lots are smaller, commercial development is concentrated in logical way, and the population consists of a wonderful mix of young and old, well-to-do and not, and a mix of ethnic groups and political persuasions. The current LD is competitive and fair, and has elected both Republican and Democratic officials for Federal, State and local public offices.  Arizona is a competitive state, and its Tucson-area LDs should be competitive. We will have better representation in a competitive district, as the competition itself will engage more citizens in the electoral process.n"

"Oro Valley is a dynamic community of professionals and businessowners.  Demographically, we range from retirees to young families. Many have a strong relationship with the Lord and faithfully attend church. A major faith community is Oro Valley  Church of Nazarene which is developing a regional community sports facility. People here are physically and mentally active, participating in all forms of sports and community activities. Northern Oro Valley has a diverse commerical area representing local and national companies. People here are sensitive to land use development issues and robustly participate in community dialogue.n"
"This area includes the areas west of Interstate 10, bordered on the south by Altar Valley, on the west by Ironwood National Monument, and Pinal County on the north.  About 25% of this area is Latino.  A great percentage of this area is rural with residential building lots of at least one acre.  Newer housing developments and shopping centers are being/have been created in the Marana area.  Multi family dwellings are not the norm. Most of this area is in the Marana Unified School District.  There is no public transportation.  

This area includes Tucson Mountain Park, Saguaro Park West and is home to another Arizona tourism draw - the Arizona Sonora Desert Museum.  The area is served by Carondelet Medical Center and the newer community healthcare centers in Marana. Residents include retirees as well as a younger crowd.nThe Picture Rocks/Avra Valley/Marana area has very little in common with the current places in LD11 that are in Pinal County, i.e., Maricopa City, Saddlebrook, Arizona City, Casa Grande, and Eloy.  Additionally, Picture Rocks/Avra Valley/Marana and Pinal County are in different media markets.

It is most important that the redistricting process be fair and competitive.  Fairness protects against extremism and promotes bi-partisanship.  New districts should not favor one party over another."
"This is a middle class complex with many first time, millenial homebuyers and retirees.  The demographics have changed a lot as man of the older owners are being replaced by younger home buyers and renters.  It also has a few section 8 renters, but overall it is a working class condo complex with some retirees as well.  Most people drive, but I know of a few who do not.  The majority of the residents are white English speakers.  There are very few people living here who are not native English speakers, not white.nThe units have recently been bought by quite a few investors too.  Airbnbs are not allowed in the building except for periods of one month or more."
"As a community we believe in the value of all people and cultures. Further we place the environment as a priority in governance and the decision making process.nThe redistricting process must maintain fair and competitive districts--which are what Arizonans wanted when they passed Proposition 106 back in 2000. It is, in fact, the AIRC's job ""to oversee the mapping of fair and competitive districts""--the specific language voters read when they passed it. The state is essentially 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 with respect to voter registration.
This is essential for cooperative, effective, and fair legislation. Gerrymandered districts in favor of one group foster graft, corruption, and the decline of the State and its people."
"I live in Oro Valley. My husband works at a diagnostic company in Oro Valley and also serves on the HOA board for our neighborhood. We attend church, shop at  grocery stores, go to doctors, dentists, and hairstylists, and enjoy restaurants in our community. Our sons were homeschooled and were active in a northwest support group. They study Taekwondo at a local school in Oro Valley.  My husband and I are precinct committeemen for LD11. Our community is primarily Christian, middle to upper middle class, college educated, with single family homes. 50% are of retirement age. We enjoy the desert natural space and mountain views that surround our neighborhoods. There are several golf courses nearby and community parks as well as a network of walking and biking paths. Many HOAs preserve the property value of our homes and community. We greatly support our police and fire department and value their services that keep our area safe.nMy community of interest has nothing in common with Flagstaff, Sedona, and the Navajo Nation which is currently included in Congressional District 1. We do not agree with the social and political views of the city of Tucson and do not want to be represented from someone who supports these areas. The city of Tucson and Flagstaff are largely liberal college towns. Our community has a nice mix of political views. Our current congressional district is a huge area and is not geographically compact as required by the Arizona Constitution. Our interests are not currently represented. Our whole Pima County has only one conservative representative in the AZ legislature. This is due to the gerrymandering that occurred 10 years ago,"
"My community of interest includes Flagstaff and its surrounding rural areas. North to the Grand Canyon, east to Winslow, West to Parks  and south to the Verde Valley.  They include the communities of Sedona, Cottonwood, Cornville, Parks and Doney Park. Many of these communities commute between our towns for work, do their shopping in Flagstaff and have friends and family scattered in this area.  We share common interests as we are tourist towns that have National Monuments and Forests nearby that draw people from around the world to our area. We are all concerned about the high cost and lack of housing and the preponderance of vacation rentals contributing to our housing shortage , and fire dangers from our forests.  Flagstaff is central to this area geographically. It ss down hill to the Verde Valley and Winslow and we are similar elevation to Parks and the Rim of the Grand Canyon, We are geographically separated from towns outside out area by mountains and Mesas and great distances. nI have lived in Flagstaff for 30 years.  I have felt that our community has not had anyone representing our values in the State Legislature for the past 10 years since the last redistricting.  I would like to see that remedied by making our legislative district more competitive in the future.  Our community has tried to ban plastic bags, increased our minimum wages and is working hard to create affordable housing options in spite of the limits the state puts on us and the lack of local control.  We would like to see these values represented at the State level.  Considering that we are the largest community in our district it seems only fair for us to have a shot at this."

Pima County is tied together because of the Sonoran Desert that we all share.  Living in the desert creates unique challenges of both environment and weather.

"Northeast Mesa includes the Falcon Field Sub-Area, city of Mesa.  This area's unique characteristics: an oasis of aviation related business, recreation, leisure and scenic vistas including communities of Red Mountain Ranch and Las Sendas, both with strong homeowners associations.  We also include the Apache Wells community. We have well planned commercial areas that fit with desert living. Our area has respect for and wants to preserve the natural beauty of the desert. We know water is precious. Most of the area's children feed into Red Mountain High School in Mesa Public Schools and we value public education.  Our LD needs to represent this entire area in order to advocate for the city, business, school, and residential communities.  Our LD needs to be competitive as our residents include Republicans, Democrats and Independents with high rates of voting.  We benefit from the careful planning of the city of Mesa.nWe are part of the city of Mesa, the 2nd largest city in Arizona.  We have Red Mountain Park and Red Mountain Recreational Center supported by our city. I have volunteered on Mesa citizen boards and know the city is part of multiple LD's and needs a more supportive voice in our Arizona Legislature.

"North Scottsdale has different needs than South Scottsdale and should have representation as such. Land issues in South Scottsdale are different than North as one is dense urban vs. natural preserve. Both cities however could share the same budget but they should also have the ability to spend the budget in a manner that best serves their community. Smaller districts would also allow for representatives to spend more time with constituents and hopefully have a much better representative local government nWhy do Buckeye and Yuma share the same district? It makes no sense. SW AZ has different needs than Central Western AZ. Districts should be made around as many individual population centers as possible. Again, smaller area allows for more meaningful time with reps to talk about issues specific to each area. "

Arizona is a ""purple"" state.  There are about the same number of registered Democrats, Republicans, and Independents.  It is also a very diverse state with its diversity having increased substantially since the last redistricting effort in 2011.  This increased diversity should be accounted for in the new redistricting maps.  This is essential for cooperative, effective, and fair representation and legislation.  Gerrymandered districts in favor of one group or party only fosters graft and corruption, and it leads to voter apathy and distrust of  government."

"I am an an Urban Native American who is enrolled with the Fort Peck Oceti Sakowin tribe in Montana, but I grew up in South Phoenix where some of my family members still live. I now live in Gilbert, AZ after returning to Arizona after surviving human trafficking in the Washington, DC area. I am able to access services to help me heal from human trafficking at the various Native American servicing institutions throughout the Phoenix and East Valley areas. I also access a critical mass of other Native Americans in my community  with the Salt River Pima and the Gila Rive Pima reservations near by, so that I am safer than I ever was when I was isolated in the DC area and therefore got targeted for not having a critical mass of Native American community to look out for me. I access Mexican/Latinx communities especially near my home in Gilbert where I can enjoy sharing culture and learning how to be a stronger community member. See additional comments, please.nI am able to access stable housing in Gilbert and Phoenix, which I didn't have when I was targeted for human trafficking. I graduated from ASU with my BS in Chemistry and am enrolled again as a student at ASU to gain computer science skills so that I can contribute even more solutions through software development, robotics, and AI for my family and community while I am employed as a national organizer for scientists. I appreciate the cultural diversity that South Phoenix, downtown Chandler, the Salt River and the Gila River reservations provide. All of these communities have helped me be a strong and competent organizer as I grew up with Black and Latinx people in South Phoenix, continue to grow with Mexican/Latinx and Native American people in downtown Chandler, Phoenix, ASU, and Gilbert areas. 
We deserve representation for the unique challenges that we face as Urban Native Aemricans. Arizona is the third top state in the USA in which Native American women go missing and murdered. "
Our community is tied together by the school districts it serves.  Kyrene serves our elementary and Middle school children.  Tempe Union High School District serves our high school population.

"The mapped area for the Public Safety Community of Interest is identified as such because of my 35 years of working with the Public Safety organizations in this area.  We trained together, provide mitigation efforts together and respond to emergency management incidents together.  This collaboration and cooperation has developed this area's responses to incidents to be professional and effective.  One issue is that both sides of the Greater Flagstaff area is split into two legislatives districts, 6 and 7.  This division impacts our abilities to coordinate as effectively as we would like when we have legislation and projects we want to communicate with our legislators.  A prime example is going to be how we best develop efforts to protect communities, transportation routes, water sheds and infrastructure with the $100,000,000 provided to plan, prepare and produce reduction of  overgrown forests around our communities.nCurrently we are tied in legislatively with the Greater Payson area which is removed from us geographically, culturally, historically and economically.

"The Kyrene School District, which encompasses all of Ahwatukee and parts of Tempe and Chandler, would seem to be an important Community of Interest. We have lived in this district for more than 30 years and have watched as its grown. Grown in population but also simultaneously in both diversity and cohesion. It is also a politically-competitive district.nI am optimistic this Commission will do as good a job as its 2011 predecessor in emphasizing fair and competitive districts statewide. It would be very disappointing if Arizona reverted to pre-Commission ways, trying to avoid competitive districts by packing minorities into a couple of districts or diluting groups among multiple districts. As you recently heard, Arizona has a sordid history when it comes to redistricting and Native Americans, for example. It is up to this Commission to make sure that it overcomes political pressure and ensures that its mapping experts produce the MOST fair and competitive maps."
"Oro Valley is a community and town that shares common interests, geographical boundaries, a tax base, recreational facilities, schools, environmental concerns, and business interests.
nHowever, Oro Valley is divided into different Legislative Districts . Part of the district is lumped in with Picture Rocks, Casa Grande, Marana, Catalina, and SaddleBrooke who do share our common values, but they do not share our community interests. There is a part of Oro Valley that is lumped into LD9 in Tucson which shares nothing in common with the rest of Oro Valley.  
Speaking as a resident of Oro Valley, I have witnessed the confusion of residents who are unsure of which LD in which they reside as there is a ""carve out"" of small portions of the town. All too often neighbors who live across the street from each other are in different LDs. This is both confusing and unnecessary.
What is ESSENTIAL is that ALL of Oro Valley be contained within the same Legislative District."

Most of our neighbors are engineers at Intel, Microchip, NXP, Freescale, Motorola, Rogers, and others. We have developed relationships with them through work, school, and church. We sit next to each other at baseball and volleyball games, support our community through work in the Tempe Diablos and the Tempe Sister City program, we volunteer at our schools (Kyrene School District and Tempe Union HS District), and worship and attend bible study together. We KNOW each other.

We live, shop, play, and worship, in the ""boundary"" described above, known to many of us as the Kyrene Corridor.nThrough work, school, and church, we have gotten to know our immediate neighbors as well as our Kyrene Corridor neighbors. We have discussions at different events that help us work through immediate challenges as well as  figure out ways to work together, no matter our differences. Bottom line, we know and support our neighbors.

Because of this relationship, the boundaries for LD18 should be kept together.

Additionally, the competitiveness of my district has driven me, as well as my neighbors, to become more involved in local politics.

"My current legislative district, 23, is not a competitive district. While Arizona as a whole is a competitive state, LD23 as currently drawn gives Republicans an unfair and unbalanced 20 point registration advantage, and only 18% of registered Independents lean Democratic. While Democrats have outperformed these numbers over the past couple of election cycles, it is inherently unfair to draw a legislative district that is not competitive by such a massive margin. On the contrary, across Arizona, Republicans hold less than a 3% registration advantage - it is close to an even split. As such, legislative and congressional district maps should aim to create districts that are fair and competitive across the state. Thank you for your consideration.n"
"As the commission redraws voting districts, I implore you to keep in mind the fundamental motivations behind Prop 106, which created the IRC. Voters created the IRC explicitly to ""END..THE PRACTICE OF GERRYMANDERING & IMPROV[E] VOTER & CANDIDATE PARTICIPATION IN ELECTIONS"".  

""Communities of interest"" is not defined in AZ Constitution, but should never be construed in a way that violates the original intent of the amendment and the voters who adopted it. A ""community of interest"", for the purposed of redistricting in AZ, should not by its nature effectively nullify the purpose of the process and enable gerrymandering to create ""safe"" legislative districts for one party or the other. This is what many commenters seem to be asking for.

Creating a contrived, backwards-C-shaped district around Tucson to group voters who vote the same way is the very definition  of gerrymandering, & is explicitly prohibited in Art 4: ""PARTY REGISTRATION & VOTING HISTORY DATA SHALL BE EXCLUDED.""nIf we carry the proposed belief-based drawing of districts to its extreme, I might note that I disagree with my neighbor about many policy issues, and could ask that my district be separated from his so that I will never have to endure having elected officials who disagree with me.  But this isn't the point. Communities of interest must have some geographic basis, not simply be a manipulated to separate us because we don't agree.

I am liberal, but more important to me than representing my political views is supporting this process: I want my fellow citizens to educate themselves and to care, because this is what benefits my ""community of interest"": my neighborhood, my city, my state, my country. When we marginalize voters by ensuring that their votes do not matter, my community, at all its scales, suffers.  

When it's done right, nonpartisan redistricting is a fantastic tool for counteracting disengagement, antagonism and polarization. Please do all you can to accomplish this ideal."

We are within easy walking distance of public transportation and services.  We have little greenspace and do not have a park.   Many of the homes in the neighborhood were built in the late 40's.  Recently, we have started losing our owner occupied properties at an alarming rate as investment companies force out owners by paying cash and over asking price.

"United States, Arizona.
In an effort to enshrine into law the drawing of ""fair and competitive districts"", in 2000, Arizona voters passed Proposition 106.  Our intention was to ensure that legislative balance would allow for equal representation of all parties.  Prop. 106 accomplished that, and for 20 years, the Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission has worked toward that goal.  The US Supreme Court upheld the legality of the AIRC in 2015.  It is vital that redistricting be done in accord with the principles of ""fair and competitive districts"", and that no political party be allowed to redraw districting lines in a way that creates an advantage of one party over others, tilting the legislative process unfairly to the detriment of We, the People, of Arizona.n"

2.  Only about 18% of registered Independents lean Democratic in LD23.

3.  The actual vote counts in the last several election cycles prove that competitiveness matters.

We share more in common with Tucson and Pima County than any future representation would reflect from redistricting our county with Cochise Co.n"
"This area has a combination of homeowners and renters and people without housing, as well. I ride my bike regularly and at all times of year along the Chuck Huckleberry Loop, from Tucson Blvd west to where it turns south at the Santa Cruz River and continues past downtown and continues south of that. Every time I see people who have spent the night and/or pass the day in or along this route and the arroyo; some have made temporary camps. There are also people sometimes in Wilson Wash, a N-S wash between Glenn and Grant. I suspect that the services that make this convenient for them are the bus routes, incl a bus terminal on N 1st Ave.  I do not know how this population accesses voting services or census counts - it must be difficult. I am writing to emphasize that this population should not be overlooked when counting voters and residents and figuring out what resources are needed. Thank you.n"
"We are a mixed middle class and lower income, educated and poorly educated, English speaking and Spanish speaking communities within close proximity to each other.  We gather for multicultural celebrations like the Dia de los Muertos and Tucson Meet Yourself.  We gather when the small circus comes to the Mercado area.  I volunteer in a local elementary school to help lower income and struggling children with reading.  We support our local communities and feel very comfortable with our Boundaries and inclusiveness of many groups.  We care about our washes and environment and strive to keep our district clean and our water healthy.

"I live in the Catalina foothills, technically in unincorporated Pima County, but my community extends beyond the foothills, with deep interconnecting roots to the south, into the City of Tucson.  My community shares contiguous neighborhoods, hiking and bike trails, several Banner medical facilities, the University of Arizona, Tohono Chul park, Tucson Botanical Garden, St. Philip’s Church and Plaza area, the bike trail Loop, parks and community volunteer activities and culinary delights.  My blended foothills and City of Tucson community is a seamless, diverse mix of cultures, educational levels, religions, economic backgrounds, and occupations, making it a vibrant and cohesive interdependent community.  Please keep my community intact.nCompetitive maps are critical to our democracy. As Arizona’s richly diverse population continues to grow, our maps must reflect our diverse electorate and our various political persuasions. Competitiveness protects against extremism and encourages better representation and voter participation as political candidates must reach out to a wider range of voters:  no voter is taken for granted, and voters are more likely to be engaged and vote.  I listened to the IRC’s hearing on August 8 in Tucson.  I was perplexed by a speaker’s comment that when maps are too competitive then one-half of the affected electorate feel cheated or left out. That makes absolutely no sense!  Was the speaker looking for maps that favor one political group over another?  If so, that not the goal of the IRC. To the contrary, if a map is truly competitive, then the IRC will have done a splendid job of giving each half of the affected electorate equal opportunity to elect the best candidate to represent the area."
"As a 30 year resident of Pinetop, home owner, prior business owner, and 17yr position with the White Mtn. Apache Tribe (Whiteriver, AZ) I value the connections of our local communities, structure, natural resources, friendships, diversity, and cultures, city and Federal jurisdictions and services.    I enjoy the present mix of people and places.n"
"Most of my neighbors are retired and enjoy living in a small town.  We like having the town, parks, and restaurants within walking distance and we like it quiet.nWe are a small community that is currently mapped in a large district, which doesn't equally represent all interests.  Please align us more with the Scottsdale area."
"The communities of Civano and Pulte Homes, which includes Sierra Morada, as well as Saguaro Trails and Rita Ranch have things in common. We are neighborhoods that are on a  vast open plateau. Many of our homes were developed with energy conservation in mind. People in these neighborhoods enjoy walking and biking paths. Civano and Sierra Morada have 30% of the land as open space, so that people can enjoy the natural desert surroundings, and all of these communities have biking paths in near proximity to the them. Employers include: Davis-Monthan, Raytheon, and U of A Research Park, which are all within short commuting distance.nMost of these homes are relatively new construction within the last 20 years."
"Sonoita is critically tied to our quality of environment, our local winery industry, and tourism. None of these concerns are shared by Cochise county.nI am 100% opposed to this change in the voting districts."
"I enter this testimony on behalf of all young people coming of age, such as my 17-year-old son, who cannot check off the standard boxes on demographic questionnaires.  He is one of a growing number of people in our world who has multiple ethnic backgrounds; Caucasian plus another.  In this case, his father is Mexican and his mother is Caucasian.  He identifies strongly with both sides of his family and has taken pains to understand the cultures that have combined to result in him.  It is important to our family that our district represents this increasing diversity, and blending, within our local neighborhoods and larger region.  We need to see people who look like us in public service, and to have people with diverse backgrounds represent us.  My son is also gay.  So, it is important that he and the many other gay citizens in our area have representation and equal rights that extend to all regardless of their ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation and identity, disabilities, etc.nWe live in a comfortable, privileged area that has great educational options, upscale housing, amenities, with employers who offer amazing benefits.  However, I feel that we should be combined with some more diverse, lower income areas so that we consider each others' needs and not just those who are most privileged.  We need to ensure that the benefits that those of us in South Tempe enjoy extend to all."
"Current LD23, very diverse income wise, including two distinct Native American nations.  The bulk of its residents, if voting as one could choose who represents them in the State House and Senate...as it has been for a decade, the winner of the Republican primary..if there even is one...Is elected. LD23 voters need hope, we need a more competitive district.n"
"This area encompasses neighborhoods in Tempe, Chandler and Ahwatukee / Phoenix that are west of Loop 101, south of US60, north of Loop 202 (south segment), and south and east of South Mountain. These areas are mutually accessible and connected geographically and by transit via I10, Loop 101, Loop 202 and US60. Services and restaurants in these areas are all very accessible to and patronized by people living in the described neighborhoods. Overall it represents a fairly drawn Community of Interest not motivated by politically partisan interests.n"
"In my prior submission, I dealt with the microcosm of Civano/Sierra Morada/Saguaro Trails/Rita Ranch. I would like to submit a larger map to show that these communities are part of greater Tucson, as our connections to the city are myriad. We shop, recreate, bike, hike, and partake of all the wonderful festivals that Tucson offers, such as Dia de los Muertos, Tucson Meet Yourself, Second Saturdays in Tucson, the winter and spring Fourth Ave. Merchants Arts Festival, the Choral Music Festival, the Book Festival, the Early Music Festival, the Guitar Festival, etc. Our ties are with Tucson and Southeastern Arizona are similar to our Congressional District 2. Large employers would be Davis-Monthan, IBM, Banner Hospitals, Tucson Medical Center, and the University of Arizona etc.nPlease ignore my prior submission as it is only a part of the whole. This map and commentary show the whole picture, the macrocosm. I would also like to urge the Independent Redistricting Committee to avoid any sort of gerrymandering, and to draw districts that are fair and competitive. Thank you for the opportunity to give input into the process."
"1.  In AZ LD23, Republicans have a 20 point registration advantage.
2.  Only about 18% of registered Independents lean Democratic in LD23.
3.  The actual vote counts in the last several election cycles prove that competitiveness matters.n"
Arizona CD6.  The heart of Maricopa County.  Two groups at least need to live in a more competitive congressional district.  We need hope that  candidates who represent our values at least have a fighting chance of being elected.n
The Patagonia community is a place where people share a common interest in cultural diversity and environmental stewardship.  The lifeblood of our local community is based on eco tourists coming to our area to bike the many miles of gravel roads and to view the multiple species of birds in our area.  It serves no interest whatsoever to Re district us into Cochise county!!n
"The community is diverse, and members have different geographic origins and retired to the area at the end of their careers. Many of the members were in public service jobs (first responders, educators, government employees) others were in professions (lawyers, physicians, engineers). There are also community members who were born and raised in the area and are not transplants from other states. While the community is divided politically, they have much more in common than they are willing to admit. The area is rural and includes people active in the agricultural industry. Religious beliefs vary but most have a Judeo-Christian background. The regional languages are primarily English and Spanish. nThe local environment is under threat of a depleted water supply that may be exacerbated in the future by the mining industry, air quality is sometimes poor again as the result of current mining practices. Public transit is poorly developed. My wife and I moved to Green Valley to escape Midwest winters, live in a quiet rural community, and to enjoy the Sonoran Desert and the Sky Islands. Changing the boundaries should be done only if its going to keep the area in its current socio-economic and demographic state. We should not be lumped in with more urban populations that have a different set of representational needs."
"Retirement villages, mixed income, mixed political affiliation, limited public transit, local and small businesses and restaurants, national businesses such as Target, Home Depot, Lowe's, Costco.  There are a number of rather well-off homes and a number of low-income homes.  A number of schools of all levels and prosperity, including University of Arizona.nI believe districts should have a variety of types of constituents so candidates and elected officials have to consider the welfare of the many rather than the welfare of the few.  This should lead to more moderate and inclusive policies."
"The Queen Creek area could use some road widening, some more parks. Very conservative. Train tracks, some business in the marketplace. Not many  open parks, but I do enjoy the open fields. It's a beautiful are with lots of farmland, some houses are built on farmland so the foundation is very rough on the houses we live in. Lots of construction on roads, lots of churches as is. Maybe we could use more gas stations. Crickets, fly's like crazy, mosquitoes, even infesting the businesses. Monsanto isn't good, for anything. Food, someone please stop MONSANTO!!!! n"
"I feel like I represent my whole community.   Yuma is a small city compared to the other cities in the state.    I  lived her for 23 years and have been back for 8 years.  I have  always been involved in the community.  I was involved in may community organization, associations, churches, social and civic.   Since I returned, I have been involved with the community, social and civic and neighborhood activities.  I am a Substitute Teacher for School District # 1 and when I lived in Yuma before moving in 1989,  I was on the School District #1 School Board Member for 12 years. Yuma is my home and I want the Yuma the City and Yuma County to be fairly represented for all the citizens that make their home here.nI represent all of the people in my community and county.   Everyone's deserves vote needs to be represented.   This should not be based on Ethnicity. Party Affiliation (Republican, Democrat or Independent) or Employment Status. Everyone that can show that they are a United States Citizen has the right to have their vote counted.  Boundaries should be set by the number of new voters in the County and City and NO OTHER WAY.  There should not be any problem drawing boundaries if the records are correct.   Each district should have a estimated size or number of people in it and how many new residents have moved in.   It is over the limit.  Then you would check the neighboring districts and see what is the best solution.  They districts should to be divided evenly. (THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO THE OF DISTRICTS BASED ON THE 3RD SENTENCE ABOVE.  I am a Substitute Teacher and we need to teach our children that we are ALL CREATED EQUAL."
"Hardworking people who care about their community, property, neighbors, and prosperity of their communityn"
"I live in LD10 and CD2 and it is fair and competitive.  I want it to remain so.

My district has 212,000 people and our voters are 1/3 Republican, 1/3 Democrat and 1/3 Independent.  We are bordered on the east by Davis Monthan Air Force Base with 14,000 employees many of whom remain here and become enmeshed in our community after service, and on the west by the University of Arizona.

My immediate neighborhood has a small town vibe, yet retains its diverse nature.
Illustrative is the diversity of religion.  Within walking distance from my house are two synagogues, A Mormon church, The Church of Christ, a Lutheran church , a new African American church and a few blocks south, a Vietnamese Catholic church.nI have lived in Tucson more than 50 years and  the economic engine of the area changed. It is now services, technology, and sustainable energy. 

Tucson was a diverse community then and has evolved in the best way possible, making it even more diverse.  Young, old, native, Hispanic, military, University students and many others.  The city itself and its environs is my community of interest.  It must stay whole and its districts must represent and give voting power to these diverse voices."
"I'd have serious reservations about being joined with Cochise County. Nogales and Rio Rico are already severely underrepresented at the state and federal legislatures. Not one representative at the state and federal level is from Nogales or Rio Rico - which is mostly Hispanic/Latino. The inclusion of Rio Rico and Nogales into a legislative district that includes Cochise County will only further dilute the Hispanic vote. The argument that the interest of voters in Nogales and Rio Rico are more aligned with the interests of voters in Cochise County is a farce and disingenuous. Our voters have consistently voted in favor of Democrat policies - which includes expanded health care, a higher minimum wage, increased educational access, and a pathway to citizenship for those without legal status, all policy issues Republicans consistently oppose. It is true that most of the constituency is religious, but in the aggregate, that is only one small factor that should be considered. n"
The city of Mesa is the city I currently live in. This community shares resources for the betterment of the community. It also has laws specific to within it's boundaries and ordinances that affect those within the boundaries. n
"Our interest groups are mostly tied by City of Mesa services: police & fire, library, trash pick up, roads, utilities, parks and by Mesa Schools - my wife & I graduated from Westwood as did all 5 of our children. Many school related friends live in this area. We seek health care mostly in Mesa. Most people living in our area are middle to lower economic class who share the same goals for safety, children's education, local government, and improvement opportunities.  Many neighbors are small business owners. We elect the Mesa government not Tempe.nMy wife and I grew up in Mesa and have lived in our home for 38 years. We participate in and relate mostly to Mesa events and activities. But the current district has us in with Tempe, not the Mesa congressional district. Even though we both graduated from ASU, we are not that connected to the interests of teachers, workers and students connected to ASU. Their interests often differ from Mesa residents."
"My husband & I escaped to Patagonia from the heart of Phoenix five years ago. We were drawn to the beauty of the area and the uniqueness of the community. We have since lured our son and his family to Patagonia so we are now three generations who are very engaged in the community and highly vested in the success of the eastern side of Santa Cruz county,  I serve on three community boards (the Patagonia Museum, the Sky Islands Tourism Association and the Red Rock Homeowners Association) and am part of an adhoc group that launched a citizens' funded economic study of the ""Nature-Based Restorative Economy"" in Santa Cruz county. Patagonia is a tight-knit community whose members, in general, share the same political views that the majority of the citizens of the western side of the county do. We have nothing in common with the political climate found in Cochise County. nOur interests in the arts, culture and a myriad of social justice issues differentiate Patagonians from the vocal MINORITY of citizens in  Sonoita and Elgin whom I understand showed up at your listening session last week claiming to speak for the entire eastern end of the county. They do not.  I frankly don't believe they speak for most of the citizens in that area. If they did, their efforts would have been publicized in advance and they were not. 

Speaking on behalf of my entire family, I urge you to leave our current legislative district intact. There is nothing positive to be gained by altering it. "
"Professionals and community volunteers living in the Catalina Foothills value Tucson’s rich cultural heritage, vibrant cultural scene, leading university, strong schools and the caring nature of our town. We were educated at Green Fields, Catalina Foothills H.S., Salpointe, the UofA, ASU and at private colleges. We love UofA sports, the Desert Museum, The Arizona Inn, San Xavier, Sabino Canyon, Mt. Lemmon and the Sonoran Desert. When we’re not at the JCC or the Racquet Club, we’re running by the Rillito. We are concerned about water and how the state manages it! We believe in smart development that preserves and enhances Tucson’s cultural, intellectual and environmental assets. Many of us work hard to keep our civic and cultural institutions strong. We belong to the Jr League, League of Women Voters, Conquistadors, AZ Town Hall and we serve on boards around Tucson. We value cooperation, working together across differences in creed, politics and culture to build a thriving community. nWe believe fair and competitive districts are essential to electing responsive legislators who will listen to all their constituents and work to secure the blessings of liberty to all as they strive for the common good. Districts that marginalize some voices by design are bad for the long term health of the community we love. Please help our community work together for a vibrant future by drawing districts in which all citizens can have a voice and a meaningful vote."
"Veterans make up 40% of residents in Yavapai County because of our V.A. Hospital in Prescott.........We have 8 Posts to serve these veterans starting in Black Canyon City, Yarnell, Dewey Humboldt, Prescott Valley, Prescott, Chino Valley, Cornville and Cottonwood.  It is important that this community of residents be recognized in your planning.nIt is important that you know about our veterans in Yavapai County."
"I am a long time resident of the Sierra Vista area, an active voter, a former 2020 Census employee and a elections worker. Our area is not represented by our LD14 elected officials. They ignore the urgent water concerns for people, nature and rivers. They allow big agriculture to suck the aquifers dry. We have beautiful areas here that need protection for tourism, birding and future generations. Please consider making our area reflect the many environmentalists who live and work in the area.nI am saddened to see the difficulty in getting candidates to run for office here! Too many districts in the State of Arizona have little or no competition. Please make us a better plan to change our future in voting and encourage voter and candidate participation."
"This community is made of many active retirement communities along with regular housing tracts. Many people that live in our community are retired but still enjoy going to local parks, golfing and dining out with friends and family. There are numerous doctors offices, hospitals and clinics to serve the large population of 55 plus seniors as well a major shopping mall, movie theaters and almost every conceivable type of grocery stores. The majority of people in this community own their cars so having good well maintained roads are must.n"
"I recently moved from mid-town Tucson to Oro Valley, so my community of interest extends beyond my current OV neighborhood as I continue to go to the mid-town and downtown .Now living in Oro Valley, I'm learning about the events, community concerns, shopping and cultural affairs here.   Covid and the Delta variant are concerns.  Most wear masks in public spaces as public safety is valued. The population is homogeneous, mostly middle and upper middle class. Average age is about 50, income over $70,000 a year, over 50% have a bachelors degree or higher.  Many people go to church. charitable institutions like the Food Bank are strongly supported.   The police are respected, drivers don't usually speed. Water supply is a concern, turf instead of grass. Outdoor recreation valued by many as they walk and bike.   People are friendly, the community is welcoming. 

 Main problem here is our representatives in Phoenix don't reflect the interests and values of OV.  LD11 should be split in half.nEmployers include companies in bioscience and hi-tech industries.   Honeywell and similar firms employ many residents.  Other employers include Amphi School District, Oro Valley Hospital and many retail stores in the area.  

Having Tucson adjacent to this northwest Pima area provides us with access to  large cultural events available at the TCC, a variety of live theaters, museums and movie theaters.  
 
Outdoor activities remain popular and Steam Pump Ranch is a popular venue for residents and tourists.  

Tucson is a better fit than Eloy 
I don't go north of the town of Catalina unless to Phoenix.  The rural areas of Pinal County that are found in Legislative District 11 are not a draw; not much of interest to do in southern Pinal County or southern Maricopa County. I'm not sure why LD11 combines parts of several smaller towns in its' northern part and why those smaller towns are often divided into LD11 and another legislative district .  Whats the point of that?"
"As a 37 year resident of South Tempe my COI is South Tempe, South Mesa, and west Chandler. I continually depend upon medical care, restaurants, shopping in this COI. I attend church in South Tempe with many close friends who reside in my COI. I volunteer for a charity book sale organization, which results in my picking up donated books throughout my COI. My COI has very similar demographics as well as high tech industry.n"
"We are growing more diverse & our unity is being tested. Where civil discourse once held us together, we are now at odds. Our founders said that our Constitution was created “to form a more perfect union”.  We yearn for election seasons to promote a meaningful exchange of differing perspectives, where all feel safe & valued, & motivated to participate. This is what advances the common good  District maps are critical in advancing this. If a district is unbalanced, only one part of the populace will feel their needs will be responded to & participation in the electoral process will decline. Give us maps which ensure that each district could conceivably elect a person of either major party & Independents (1/3 of the populace) will be fully engaged. If our leaders are intent on vanquishing the minority, rather than advancing a “more perfect union”, bitterness & extremism will grow as a cancer, & we will be weak locally & nationally.nArizona has been a national leader in advancing fair and competitive districts. Thus we have this commission. Inherent to all this is the provision of fair & open elections. The Voter Rights Act of 1965 prohibits discrimination in voting. It prohibits any voting practice that denies or abridges the right of any citizen to vote .It is the spirit of that law that elections ensure one vote for every citizen, whoever they may be.  Elders in  our community need open access to voting. Ensure the integrity of our Permanent Early Voting List, Early Voting, and the safety & privacy of voting, that elder citizens will not fear engaging in the process.   Maneuvers to discourage citizens from voting or make it more confusing undermines the foundation which the framers of our Constitution laid  Encourage, in every way possible one vote per citizen, by every citizen and concord, not division, will prevail, & we will become the great nation that we aspire to be."
"Our community is more east to west from Springerville to Show Low and the whole White Mtn area our main concerns  are the forest conditions, wolf predations , hunting, fishing and tourismnOur concerns are never addressed and I feel we are poorly represented"
"Very divided politically but united around the love for the natural beauty of the area.  (My personal community of interest is LD23 Democrats and especially Four Peaks Precinct.)  The geographic community however is overwhelmingly skewed toward Republicans so that the many excellent, competent, honest Democratic candidates don't appear to have a chance even against Republicans with scandals, poor record of accomplishments, and a real lack of principles.  The Republican candidates refuse debates , fail to meet with constituents, and still win.  There is no reason for them to respond to their constituents needs since they are secure in their positions.nIn my opinion, the districts need to be redrawn to make them more competitive thus forcing candidates to have to work for their reelection by providing good government."
"Our community encompasses all of Apache County and all of Navajo County, plus Tribal lands whose boundaries extend beyond the county lines.    Our community consists of Native Americans, descendents of white and Latino settlers, retirees who have joined the community, and others.  We are diverse.  That is our strength.  Our numbers are not large, so we must band together in large districts in order to have representation for our rural area's unique needs.   Many of us bridge cultural differences and work together to serve our communities, protect our environment and strengthen our schools.  
Some people in our area will ask you for maps that are one-sided. That would be wrong and would be too divisive for us.  We must have competitive voting districts so that all our different voices will be fairly represented.  We want our candidates to listen to everybody.  Partisan districts typically pre-decide elections in the primaries, which encourages intolerance for moderate voters. nEnjoyment of our outdoor environment unites most of us. We all know we have to protect our watersheds and our clean aquifers at all costs. There is much concern about fracking operations that will poison our aquifer.  We all worry about wildfires and drought. We want to see an end to uranium mining close to the Grand Canyon. The half-century old abandoned uranium mines must be cleaned up.
Rural economic issues are common to all parts of our community. We need to add 21st-century economic development to the existing farming, ranching, tourism and other industries. We must transition to clean renewable energy production, as large coal-burning power plants are closing.  We can't expect young people to stay in the community if we only offer them a 19th-century economy. We all need investment in infrastructure, schools, internet, communications, and roads--we all drive a lot in order to access services."
"Well, I believe that we should try as best as possible to keep the kyrene school district area together. This is a strong community that has a diverse set of interest and goals that are committed to building a brighter future for our children and all of Arizona. The ahwatukee, chandler, and Tempe area is a great community that shares a lot of common interests such as the kyrene school district and I believe that this community is only going to grow because it is a welcoming and close knit community of proud Arizonans. n"
"My community is Kyrene School District.  Kyrene is a source of pride in this community, I went to Kyrene schools from K-8th grade and we built friendships and rivalries with each other. The district is more than just city pride because Kyrene includes kids from Tempe, Chandler, and Ahwatukee. Many of the friends that I have known all my life come from the different schools in the Kyrene district and it is a distinct community.  Students and educators in this area deserve to have our issues and concerns to be championed in the state legislature by representatives that will need to listen our voices.n"
"I live in congressional distric 2, legislative district 10. 
For the past two days I listened in on citizens of differnt communities reaching out to you on why their district lines should be drawn one way or another. What I heard was a lot of partisanship. Overwhelmingly individuals in certain areas felt they needed to be represented by people that were ""like mind"". And based on the testimonials one might think all citizens living in that community are the same and needed to be insulated from others that aren't the same. Most had the same script, places where they shop and eat, horseback riding, rural life, and places of worship. 
Listen, we're all individuals and we should not assume others will usurp our rights. Democracy is about embracing differences and working together. I don't want to be walled off from them but I heard explicitly they want to be walled off from the likes of me and others that don't fit in with their beliefs. Please don't buy in to the rhetoric.nI truly believe walling off districts to focus on ""like minded"" individuals is inherently undemocratic  and against what our US Constitution intended. We have to get beyond the partisanship and work together. Please keep the districts as they are, fair and competitive."
"Southern Arizona, the expanse below the Gila River has a commonality of interest, history, language, culture, environment, and economic vitality. Rather than divide the area by skin colors and household incomes, it would be very beneficial to all who live there to understand and promote the many things they have in common. With appropriate competitive voting districts, residents can maximize the community for all.  I attended both Listening Tour days in Tucson. ""Otherness"" was promoted by those living in rich enclaves about those who did not live in their enclave. Why not share respectfully? 

I  support the testimony given by Supervisor Grijalva and appreciate that the Commission recognized its value and gave her additional time to complete her remarks.  I also appreciated the specific information highlighted by Barbara Tellman. She pointed out the disenfranchisement being experienced by 4 precincts 4 hours drive outside their Yuma district. Please avoid such unfair setups this year.nI have lived in Pima County for almost 50 years and have been fortunate to have lived in several areas. The ""Listening Tour"" chose to hold its public meetings only in predominantly white neighborhoods.  When that was pointed out, the faces of the Committee members seemed genuinely surprised.  It highlighted the lack of information and of interest by the Commission about the southern Arizona area.  In addition, the mispronunciation of  County Supervisor Adelita Grijalva's Hispanic surname furthered that impression. Please sharpen your understanding of the diversity of the  people who live in this state.  Follow Steve Lynn's advice and draw the lines for a public purpose and not for political or personal aggrandizement. How  about a meeting on the southside or in midtown Tucson?"
"I am a retired educator living in Oro Valley, Arizona(presently LD11 and CD1). Oro Valley is part of Tucson, Arizona, Pima County. When I travel nationally and internationally I say I am from Tucson, Arizona. 
My present state legislators do not represent me or my values.
I feel a direct economic and common interest with Tucson. My appointments, recreation, connection is with Tucson, Marana and Oro Valley, not Pinal County which is the LD and CD I am in now. My Dr.'s appts. and shopping and social activites also includes Marana. I do not have any community connection with Casa Grande or Pinal County. 
My news and information comes from Tucson radio and TV stations.

I ask that Oro Valley and Marana be included in Legislative and Congressional Districts with Tucson and Pima County.n"
"I am part of the Phoenix Union School Distrct. Where according to the Census we have over  33 percent of children that live below poverty line and over  81% of families that are Latinos.nI am requesting that the maps are fair and ensure competitive races, as well as protect the voting power of our community.

We need to ensure that elected officials understand  the dynamics and listen the needs of our community."
"The community bordered on the north by Guadalupe, Cooper on the East, Elliot on the south and McQueen to the west is a very cohesive community nFrom what I understand a “precinct “ is configured such that all registered voters can cast a ballot on Election Day.  Over the last several years, there has been an elimination of over 1,000 precincts statewide. 

We need to get back to what the state constitution calls for and reconfigure and institute voting precincts that allow all registered voters to cast their ballots on Election Day."
"My Legislative District 18, drawn in the last redistricting session, 2010-2011, is a diverse and politically balanced community, joined together by common neighborhoods, parks, shopping, utilities, streets and services.  Most of all, it is currently linked by Kyrene School District, that covers the same boundaries.  To extend this district into Pinal County would creat a waste of political resources and energy on the part of our legislators, who would have nothing in common or knowledge of the County they do not reside in.  Please do your best to keep the Kyrene School District together!  It will be greatly appreciated!n"
"Mesa, Arizona, is inhabited by largely Caucasian and Hispanic middle class families, with an Asian-American  neighborhood contained as well. We are hard working and need our green space, police departments strong and taxes low. We are a largely blue and white collar bunch of citizens. There is much Christianity and Latter Day Saints celebrated in our community, and many people rely upon the travel industries w golf and , spring training venues especially. There is also a large contingency of veterans and of partial year older residents because of our recreation venues and associations. We need clean healthy air and schools, and more small business to fulfill the diversity in our community. nThe previous maps that were drawn did not have properly represented Communities of Interest. Many of the districts were divided unfairly by populations— with as much as a 12% discrepancy in inhabitants  common. 
It is important that the committee get the district maps correct this time around BY ADHERING TO ALL SIX OF THE CRITERIA SET FORTH IN THE CONSTITUTION. 
Districts should be compact and accurately represent communities of interest who live and work together."
This community is both rich in diversity and in common ground. We have both renters who were here in search of a forever home that are comfortable enough to stay. We have a population of retired people and people who were first time homebuyers. We have many teachers employed by one of the local schools and we also have doctors and many nurses working for Banner or Dignity Health hospitals. We have churches in the area many people attend and then some churches just a little further out that others also attend.n
"large retirement community of seniors in Saddlebrooke thru Oro Valley; higher education, higher income; active social, political constituents who volunteer for schools and non-profits; higher income jobs; close medical facilities; not rural area like other areas in Pinal Countyncurrent boundaries for local house of representative in Saddlebrooke includes geographic areas that have nothing in common with each other; Saddlebrooke residents are vastly different than the rest of the district; rural vs semi rural; income; political ideology; occupations; etc...  I feel current boundary is gerrymandered so that it is impossible to have a decent race of Demo vs. Republican.  No democratic will ever be elected from my district based on boundaries...no even a close election.  I wish more competitive boundaries so people vote for candidate not party"
"LD2 is primarily a rural community that is highly diverse in terms of race, age, ethnicity, income, education level and occupation.  We are threatened by unregulated mining activity that impacts our water supply, harms sensitive ecosystems and endangers critical populations of rare animals and plants.  We should remain a rural community in any redistricting and provided with protection from water scarcity, climate change and habitat loss.n"
"I live in CD 2 and LD 10. Both are competitive, and while the candidates I support f don’t always win, I appreciate the healthy diversity that motivates people to the polls. I believe the competitiveness forces us to select nominees that are more centrist, helping assure that the majority of people feel connected and properly represented. I believe it keeps our elected officials from becoming complacent or too extreme. I also believe that this centrist representation helps us live in harmony.

For instance, families surrounding my home are Asian, white, Hispanic, and Muslim.  My family is mixed race. While it is easy to see some levels of diversity with one’s eyes, it is harder to see other difference, such as political stance. Yet, the diverse political signs make that obvious during voting season. Still my neighborhood is filled with families walking, jogging, talking, and laughing together. It is a good place to live.nI strongly urge you to keep our districts diverse and competitive. Keep them organized in geographic boundaries that are natural and inclusive of many types of people. In doing so, you will keep us motivated to elect representatives that can serve us all, so we can continue living together and enjoying the shared values such as good health, family, and a strong sense of community."
"State of ArizonanDuring this evening's Listening Tour event in Mesa I heard several speakers expressing concern that some legislative districts were drawn with ""12%"" more population than others. Upon researching this talking point, it seems that this was litigated before the US Supreme Court in Harris v. Arizona and in a 9-0 decision, this variance was considered permissible.

Further, many speakers referred to the text of the IRC law to argue in favor of city-based districts and against competitiveness. I would refute that position by stating that the law specifically calls for favoring competitive districts over non-competitive districts (the sixth criterion set forth in the law). So I encourage the commission to pursue health competitive districts wherever and whenever possible."
"Guadalupe is about half Yaqui (bilingual) and half more recent Mexican descent (many bilingual, some Spanish only). Most people here are essential workers. There is a deep tradition with lots of traditional Mexican and religious festivals, especially around Christmas and Lent. There is one park in the middle of Guadalupe that is used to play baseball or other uses, and one by the canal. There is a Yaqui church and a Catholic church. There are a lot of vehicles in various states of disrepair on some properties, and several empty lots, some with venerable old trees that are stressed because of the drought. This small city has a fairly responsive government and seems to be run in the interest of its residents, but the tax base is probably lower than most areas of Phoenix. It is an area where many residents walk or ride a bike, which makes it more neighborly than other, more suburban places. There are many very good restaurants and other small businesses, and a large Yaqui tribal building.nOne wonderful aspect of Guadalupe is that there are no HOAs. People here love their children and there often are big birthday parties with inflatable amusements, music, and laughter. Many people here are marginalized and barely scraping by, and often there are several families sharing a lot with various types of dwellings in close proximity.
Living in Guadalupe is like living in a small town. There are essentially only four streets leading in or out of town, so many people aren't even aware that it exists. Before the pandemic, in the Mercado, which is like the town's main square within 4 walls, you could often listen to music and bring the family to enjoy the evening."
"My name is Denny Thomason and I live in Mesa in Maricopa County.  These are my communities of interest.

My family homeschools and my husband works from home, so our main hub is our home on Sossaman and Guadalupe Rd. and the immediate area for shopping and restaurants.  We grocery shop at the Fry's on Power and Baseline and at the Costco on Sossaman Rd. 

We often shop at Superstition Springs Mall and San Tan Village Mall.  We also frequent the restaurants near San Tan Mall and Superstition Springs Mall area. 

Our family frequently visits extended family on Val Vista and Baseline and on Crismon and Guadalupe Rd. As homeschoolers we participate in a co-op bi-weekly on Greenfield and Ocotillo.

We frequently use the Southeast Regional Library and often go to the Riparian Preserve at Water Ranch for relaxation and exercise. We attend church in Gilbert and our doctors our in Gilbert. My children take musical instrument lessons on Southern and Higley and dance lessons near San Tan Village.nI am concerned about the re-districting of my community and sincerely hope that the commission follows the Constitution by adhering to all six of its criteria for re-districting. The previous commission focused too much on competitiveness.

I believe districts should be compact in order to accurately represent communities of interest who live and work together."
"I'm sorry to struggle with using the map function above.
I observe that Yavapai communities such as Prescott, Prescott Valley, Chino Valley, Mayer, Cottonwood, Sedona share similar retiree and rural populations. They should be kept together. At the Yavapai IRC meeting I attended, some said that the Mingus Mountain marks a big difference between communities in Yavapai county. But that is incorrect. People drive over the mountain regularly. For example: I had a co-worker who commuted to Prescott from Camp Verde and have a Dewey hiking friend whose husband works in Cottonwood. My hiking club frequents trails on both sides of the county. When I sang in Yavapai College choir, we gave concerts in campuses on both sides of the county. When I was a CASA volunteer,  I learned that judges serve on both sides of the county. My husband drove to Cottonwood for his Covid shot. The interests of those on both sides align so please don't separate Yavapai county by the Mingus Mountains. Thank you.n"
I have previously submitted a map. I want to submit an additional comment. nPeople who don't speak English need to be proactively contacted in their language. And people without easy access to internet need to be reached in other ways. You cannot expect these people to contact you to ask for accommodations since the issue is they don't even know this is happening or have the ability or knowledge of how to contact you. You need to take the advice of speakers at the public hearing tonight to proactively meet disadvantaged communities where they are so they can get their equal say. One way is using paid tv and social media advertising in their languages. 
"I live way east of Gila Bend off grid, using Solar for electricity and a well for water.  I do work in the southern part of Phoenix in my own business.  I attend Church in Tempe, so our time in the city versus on our ranch is fairly balanced.  We have learned to not rely on any kind of service, for example, if the sheriff is called we know it will take 30 minutes in an emergency at best.  When in the city, the needs and concerns are much different.  Country life we really only worry about migrants doing damage as they pass thru, but in the city it can be a laundry list of concerns as we work in the many different communities.nThe AZ Constitution is clear on the guide lines.  Our Constitution is the contract that the people of AZ and the public servants that took an oath to uphold, which means that I may not like the results if the Constitution is followed, but I also should expect the Constitution to be followed.  When a statute for example is written and passed that goes against what the Constitution stats, then that Statute is in violation.  In redistricting, if Competition is emphasized to be the most important concern, when it clearly states it is to be the least and not a detriment to the other criteria's, this would violate that contract with the people.  LD4/CD3 is a clear example of this violation.  By trying to make every district purple we encourage hating each other to win a close race.  We also tempt each side to find ways to cheat or take advantage of the rules to win at all cost.  It has not fostered communication by representatives.  Finally, it has caused races to become expensive to win."
"I am speaking in favor of keeping Santa Cruz County, a small but unique county, in one legislative district, one that also encompasses the Pima County towns of Green Valley and Sahuarita. This scenic rural area on both sides of the Santa Cruz River is a destination for tourists from not only the US but also many other parts of the world. They are interested in birdwatching, hiking mountain trails, or visiting wineries, and are  important to the economy of the district. People of different backgrounds and professions— astronomers, scientists, ranchers, painters,  people seeking to live in a rural setting are committed to being responsible stewards of the land.  nOur common interests unite us when we seek legislative and congressional representatives who will work to protect water, habitat, and wildlife. Splitting off segments of the district will undermine this unity. Moving a portion of Santa Cruz County voters to a district that has historically committed to priorities other than wildlife issues and land stewardship will prevent their voices from joining with the majority of voters who oppose environmental destruction by mining and over development."

There are movements currently afoot all over the country to gerrymander districts to favor Republican victories because they fear that's the only way their party can win. A large contingent of today's Republican voters are driven by fear and conspiracy theories.

"Largely single family, suburban/rural community, consisting of a significant retiree population.  Surrounding area is developing as a bedroom community south of Tucson in Pima County.  Primary languages are English and Spanish.  Population largely Caucasian and Hispanic.  Largely middle income population.  Good roadway connections to urban area (Tucson), but limited public transportation to/from and around the community of interest.  No passenger rail service, although major commercial rail lines proceed through community (north / south) between Mexican border through to Tucson.  Land usage is expanding for mining, which is becoming disruptive to the quiet residential nature of the community.  Active social and civic networks within the area.  Fair number of hiking paths, but few dedicated bicycle paths for a population looking for additional safe means of outdoor exercise, such as cycling.  n"
"I live in the Village of Oak Creek one of the unincorporated communities in the Verde Valley.

I respectfully request that the Commission keep the Verde Valley communities together with Prescott and all of the other Yavapai County communities.

One of the things I learned early on about rural communities is that our strength comes from the combined efforts with other communities to accomplish a common goal.  We have many shared values and concerns, including the preservation of small town character and the conservation of our waterways and natural environment.  

And nothing unites us quicker than a land use issue when it involves high density developments or large scale hotels.  Our land use matters are not limited to individual communities.  They are interconnected, touching upon issues such as transportation,  traffic, fire safety, sustainability, water use, culture etc.  El Rojo Grande and the new hotel in the Village of Oak Creek are examples of Verde Valley combined efforts.  nOur connection with Prescott/Yavapai County is stronger than Flagstaff/Coconino County:

1.  Prescott is the center of the Yavapai County Government.  There are 4 unincorporated communities in the Verde Valley including the Village of Oak Creek.

2.  According to US Census Bureau QuickFacts estimates,  42.2% of the population of the Village of Oak Creek is over 65 years old.  In Flagstaff that percentage is only 8.4%  That is a big difference. In Prescott,  37.3% of the population is over 65 years.  In Coconino County, that percentage is 13% and in Yavapai County that percentage is 32.5%.

It makes sense to keep the entire Yavapai County together.  Yavapai County consists of rural communities with similar lifestyles, values and concerns.  We are interconnected through our land and water use, transportation,  farming/ranching and culture.  The retirement community is better represented by Yavapai County."
"As a community we believe in the value of all people and cultures. Further we place the environment and sustainability as priorities in governance and the decision making process. All future ""development"" must be completed with responsible, thoughtful, environmentally sustainable guidance and regulations.nThe redistricting process must maintain fair and competitive districts. The state is essentially 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 with respect to ====[[voter registration.
This is essential for cooperative, effective, and fair legislation. Gerrymandered districts in favor of one group foster graft, corruption, and the decline of the State and its people."
"The Santa Cruz River Valley on both sides of Interstate 19 and future IS-11 consists of City of Nogales, Rio Rico, Tubac, Town of Patagonia, Green Valley, City of Sahuarita, Sonoita and Elgin. We are bounded by East and West mountain ranges and the Tumacacori NHP, Lake Patagonia State Park, Tubac State Historical Park, two Wilderness Areas, three Coronado National Forest regions and other tourist sites including high quality bird observation areas. 
   Santa Cruz County has a boundary with Mexico with a large Border Patrol Station. The immigration problem is manageable with minor impacts in this area and IS-19 corridor. Drug smugglers usually transport via vehicles on Interstate 19 and stopped at the BP Check Point. Armed Forces personnel are not stationed here. 
   Our major industry is $2 billion packing Mexican produce. Over 300 local abandoned mines have continuing pollution issues.
    Green Valley is a retirement community; Sahuarita is a dynamic residential development.nCongressional District 3 and State District 2 are best without any changes. 
   Santa Cruz County has 15,059 Democrat; 5,081 Republican; 9,886 Independent; and 185 Libertarian active registered voters (1 Jul 21) in both. 
    In CD 3, Pima County has 78,674 D's, 28,894 R's, 69,679 I's and 1,191 L's; Maricopa has 53,175 D's, 37,054 R's, 53,589 I's and 1,212 L's; Pinal 159 D's, 9 R's, 86 I's; and Yuma 25,238 D's, 13,401R's, 23,492 I's and 410 L's.

"I can’t figure out how to designate my area of interest on the map. It is the area representing CD6. Because of the outsized voter registration advantage of republicans in my district, Republican candidates and elected officials feel no obligation whatsoever to address my concerns as a Democrat. That includes social issues, economic issues, justice issues, taxation, education issues and public health issues. In effect, I have no representation. When redrawing lines, I urge you to close the gap in party representation to more closely reflect all of Arizona.n"
"The nearest available services and grocery are natural gathering places and require us to use common travel corridors, i.e., Hwy 77. Oracle school district ties SaddleBrooke, SaddleBrooke Ranch, and Oracle to each other on a second level.nThe IRC must comply with the Arizona Constitution, as amended by the people in 2000, in drawing contiguous districts that include communities of interest, and are as diverse as possible--two criteria that must be balanced within the first criterion. It can be done. The perfect map would be completely ""purple"" districts."
"Our neighbors and we enjoy a rural county lifestyle afforded by our serene and heavy industry-free surroundings. We are located on a major bird migration corridor and a variety of wildlife live peacefully among us, sharing the land. Bird-watching tourism is a low impact piece of our economy. We do not favor large-scale residential, commercial or industrial development. Our wine industry is growing and is the sort of low-impact commerce we prefer. We also support the local livestock (cattle) industry, which assures the future of our open space. Our existing county zoning protects our cherished lifestyle. We do not favor Rosemont Mine and would lose our voice, should we be forced into a political community not of our choosing. The people who are attempting to convince you the majority of Sonoita/Elgin residents dislike our association with Santa Cruz County are knowingly misrepresenting reality! nThis group of dissidents is small and loud and stealthy but they do not in any way represent us or the majority of our friends and neighbors. Our community at large is absolutely not in favor of being moved from Santa Cruz county to Cochise county. Most residents do not even know this subversive effort is afoot and would be as appalled as I am. Our community, Sonoita/Elgin, has little in common with Cochise county. If we had wanted to live in Cochise county we would have bought property there 20 years ago. We did not then and we do not now. This small group of vocal and pushy individuals should just move there if this is their desire. Believe me, they will not be missed!"
"My COI is inside Pima County and not closely attached to Pinal Cty.  I see my district as inclusive, divers, and competitive.  My interests are in and near Tucson.  My media is all from Tucson not Phoenix.  My social interests are here in Marana, Oro Valley, Catalina, and all of Tucson.  My district needs to provide ME with the candidates that have an equal chance of getting voted into office, which is NOT the case with the current district.  We do not have many common interests with most of Pinal Cty.  I see my COI as the greater Tucson ""circle"".nThank you for the work the commission is doing...it's a huge endeavor but crucial to bringing balance and the opportunity for our votes to matter.
Government is local...we have all just witnessed what happens when the Gen election has the largest participation in our history and yet our State officials are running the show for the losing party.  It is critical to everyone's welfare to have a voice where the real decisions affecting daily life are made.
My map isn't very good but I hope my comments express my COI."
"The SaddleBrooke community relates almost entirely to the north Tucson suburbs of Catalina and Oro Valley.  That is where all the residents shop, go to social events and volunteer for activities.  I almost never go to Florence or Casa Grande.  It should be included along with north Pima County in any redistricting and not with the rest of Pinal countynI was not sure how to use the map so I just described what I believe is the trade area and personal use area that would make sense for a district."
"As a resident in the Elgin region in Santa Cruz County for the past 15 years, I strongly oppose any proposal to shift the Sonoita/Elgin region to district boundaries that include Cochise County thereby separating us from other regions of Santa Cruz County.  The geographic, social, economic and political cohesion of the Sonoita/Elgin area (along with Patagonia) is much greater with Nogales, Tubac, and Tucson than it is with Sierra Vista and the remainder of Cochise County. While there are a number of vocal conservatives in Sonoita and Elgin who do not want to be affiliated with moderates and liberals in Santa Cruz County, they do not represent a range of active communities here who are dedicated to protecting natural resources and promoting economic development through our environmental assets and growing wine industry.n"

"Latinos make up about a quarter of eligible voters in Arizona -- and growing. Latinos make up nearly a third of the state's population -- and growing. Yet there is no Latino representation on the Commission or its executive leadership. The Commission has failed to hold citizen hearings in predominately Latino communities, such as South Phoenix, Laveen and Maryvale in Maricopa County. The Commission also has not held hearings on Latino Minority Districts or hearings on Racially Polarized Voting. The Commission held one specifically for Native Americans, but not for Latino-centric voting. The Commission has not taken into account the Digital Divide and its impact on the Latino community, with many Latinos unable to go online to comment. There has been no Community Outreach Coordinator dedicated to ensure a wider audience at public meetings. CPLC Action Fund is calling on the Commission to hold additional hearings in the aforementioned communities and also on the aforementioned issues. n"

"1. My parish. I was confirmed at St. Timothy's Catholic Church on Guadalupe, across from Dobson High School. Through St. Timothy's, I was introduced to Paz de Cristo, a homeless shelter on Broadway, in Mesa. There I help with the shower service on Wednesdays and enjoy the company of other parishioners, mostly of St Timothy's.
2. My daughter's school. She briefly attended Corona del Sol, a high school in Tempe Union High School District, but the school was so bad she transferred in her sophomore year to Tempe Preparatory Academy, on Southern. Tempe Prep is a charter school. My daughter graduated in 2014 but I remain active in fund-raising and assisting with the senior essay.
3. My wife's music series. My wife, Catherine Hayden, is responsible for a 5-concert classical music series that she presents at the Tempe Center for the Arts. 

If you were to connect these dots, the resulting shape would look a lot like Tempe.nMy Legislative District, 18, extends east-west from south Phoenix to Mesa. It is not compact. It is not a community I recognize. My Congressional District, 9, is even more spread out, to south Phoenix in the same way LD18 is, and also, north into Scottsdale and Arcadia. It looks like the salamander we are all trying to avoid."
"I moved to Patagonia several years ago and built two small houses, one with the goal of providing an affordable rental option for local residents. I chose the Patagonia area because of its sense of community, its reputation as a world class birding destination, its values of caring for each other and the environment. For example, when the Patagonia HS boy's basketball team made it to the semi's (and lost), the community turned out to welcome them home. Border Patrol, Fire Department, and the Marshall's office met the bus at the county border and escorted the bus into Patagonia where residents had lined main street in their cars, lights on, music and horns blaring, to welcome the boys and families home. It was a wonderful site and one that well represents our community. Although the community recognizes the value of mining in the area, we also believe it needs to be developed responsibly and with a look to the long term consequences for the environment, including water conservation.
nI am seriously concerned that redrawing the voting district boundaries and moving Sonita/Elgin to Cochise County will significantly diminish our voice in future elections.  Please please please DO NOT redraw the legislative boundaries and move our wonderful Patagonia community to Cochise County. It is a small (but admittedly vocal) subset of the population that is pushing for this move. It will not serve the best interests of our community."

When I got my Covid shot I got it through the Marana Healthcare. I have no idea why I vote with Pinal County since they are more agriculture and mining and Oro Valley and Marana are more urban and can identify with Tucson and even the reservation south of Tucson.  Most of the people I know that live in Pinal rarely go into Tucson for anything other than maybe to venture down for a restaurant.  They don't read the Tucson Newspapers or take advantage of the Tucson entertainment.  They tend to stay put and not venture out of their area.

"SaddleBrooke is an active adult retirement community on the northern outskirts of Tucson.  Our snail mail address is, in fact, Tucson.  Culturally and economically, we are tied to Tucson.  But our current Federal Congressional district, #1, extends all the way up to the northern border of AZ and we have very little in common with communities in that part of AZ.  Our current district is one long strip extending almost from the southern border to the northern border of the state.

I have over the year tried to advocate for interests and have been ignored by my representative.  The lack of competitiveness in my broader community of district 8 leads to hyper partisanship and portions of our community being underrepresented.nThe ultimate goal of the commission should be to draw competitive districts.  Doing this will encourage bipartisanship and help to encourage elected leaders to work for ALL members of the community vs. pandering only to their party base.  In addition, it can help motivate and encourage members of the community to participate in the election process and provide a feeling that all voices matter and all votes matter.  Non-competitive districts can lead to less of a participation in the election process.  We ALL need to feel like we have a voice.  Elected leaders need to realize that they represent ALL people in a community.  Competitive districts are the only way to accomplish this."

"Oro Valley is part of the Tucson metropolitan area and has few connections with Pinal County to the north.

Established in 1974 to provide urban services to developing area north of Tucson.
Now contains wide range of commercial and medical services (including a hospital).
Residents very concerned about environmental issues including adjacent Catalina State Park and Pusch Ridge Wilderness. 
Services are provided by both Pima Country and Tucson.  Pima County provides  flood control, library, sewers, and regular county services.  Tucson provides regional bus service and water to parts of town.  Amphitheater School District covers all of Oro Valley and extends into Tucson.
Residents also use commercial services in the area between Oro Valley and Tucson.
Media available and used by residents are from Tucson -- radio, television, cable, and newspaper (Arizona Daily Star). 

(See additional comments.)nThe previous redistricting for the legislature and Congress split Oro Valley off from our greater community of interest.  In the legislature we were put with Pinal County which is more rural and goes to the Phoenix area for media and services.  In Congress the district is mainly rural and goes clear to the Utah boundary.   

Please recognize that we are part of the Tucson metropolitan area should be not be used add population to the areas to the north."
"The Patagonia , Sonoita, wine country of Elgin and the Sky Islands share environmental concerns and recreational resources and should be grouped together as Communities of Interest.  Eco-tourism and Birding alone constitute a healthy bond throughout this area, interests not necessarily shared by nearby larger towns in Cochise County.  Please keep this in mind when drawing governmental lines.  To separate and disperse these communities will essentially silence these communities and shut down the financially beneficial and environmentally beneficial efforts long established here. n"

"I am a retired software engineer who moved to Arizona 15 years ago.  I find commonality with people from all different socio-economic groups, ethnicities and religion.nI believe competitive districts encourage more moderate voices and leads to higher voter turnout.   Our state is deeply divided and we see extremism in our elected officials who come from ""safe"" districts.  Although our State Legislature is very close with regard to the number of Democrats and Republicans, for all intents and purposes the minority party doesn't exist.  The decisions that this commission makes will have serious and long-lasting effects on this State.  You, above others, have a lot of power in what type of State we all live in.  Please put partisan issues aside and do what is right and what an overwhelming majority of AZ voters asked for when the commission was created.  Create competitive districts.  Competitive districts encourage candidates and elected officials work with all the constituents, not just special interests.  Thank you for your time and commitment to a better democracy.  The future of Arizona rests in your hands."
"My Community of Interest is the area that includes all of the Kyrene School District (sorry if my map is off, I had trouble navigating).This area includes Ahwatukee, Chandler and Tempe and is an important aspect my community, providing a unified social, civic, educational and economic focus to my neighborhood. In conclusion I ask that all 26 schools in the Kyrene School District be kept together as a Community of Interest.n"
"I am Jan Budak I live in the Houghton Corridor zip code 85748.  I am the chairperson for LD 10 Precinct 181. I also am an advocate for After Care Homes and Facilities that provide After Care Programs for the recused humans who have been victimized by the Trafficking industry.
As you mentioned on slide four of your presentation the constitutional provisions in article 4 pt.2 section 1(14) there are six constitutional goals for redistricting that the commission is bound to use.  The voting act rights is another consideration while determining the boundaries; which then leaves the areas that have changed either by population growth, economic expansion, land development, industry, and the addition private schools/charter schools.    I would like address the policies that will affect public safety.
Currently, we Arizonians, have one of the largest and most lucrative trafficking industries operating in the United States.  Please continuing reading in the next set of comments.nI have developed a heightened level of public safety.  To our credit, we have several After Care facilities and homes peppered throughout rural Arizona and many on Horse properties and ranches.
 Defunding the Police became policy we tried changing that policy.  To do that we would need to have a voice and right now with our boundaries we don’t have that voice.   
The communities of interest that need their voice heard are contained in the areas north of the river including Marana, Saddle Brooke, Catalina foot hills, to the Rincon Mountains.  Then the Houghton Corridor, as far south as Green Valley (Which makes a backward “c”).  They are a very different community than the city of Tucson.  
Making these boundary changes would rectify and correct the imbalance of representation and create competitive Legislative districts.
Congressional districts are extremely wrong.   I’m hoping the census will provide a better resolution, we need to have a voice in selecting our congress."
"It is extremely important that the I-19 corridor and South Tucson remain in the same political district due to the likeness and diversity of our communities. There are many reasons to keep it this way and probably the most important one is the billions of dollars in revenue that come to Arizona as a result of the International trade that has been taken place for the past 150 years. All of my children live in Tucson, I do most of my shopping in Tucson.n
We can not allow the limited self interests of a small group of people who are trying to push their religious agenda on the current politics of our state. The Bill of Rights and our constitution does not allow for our religious beliefs and views to dictate the redistricting and boundaries in Arizona. The Constitution is very clear when it comes to separation of church and state and we need to keep it that way."
"School District. Church District. Sports District. We intermingle with our neighbors in many different ways, whether it be through schools, churches, and different activities that involve ourselves and our families. Our holidays, traditions, celebrations, values. hopes, and dreams for one another. nMy family has lived in Chand & the Gilbert School District for 35 yrs. Our zip is 85225. We are in LD17/CD9.

Kids went to Gilbt sch involved on many sport teams/musical groups all in Gilbt. Our church is also in Gilbt we own a rental property in Gilbt I do much volunteer serv in Gilbt. 

When district lines were redrawn a splinter of our comm was divided & moved into a much larger area not of our comm of interest.  Since we have not had adequate representation/cohesion for 10 yrs. 

Since CD9 was created our comm of int has been broken, & we have not been able to send a Rep of our choice to Wash DC. Our comm should be kept as whole. 

We hand picked where we wanted to raise our family/retire & this comm had the values we desired. 

I attended mtg in Mesa on 8/9 & had to leave before able to speak but I heard over again all felt their comm had been split. I know our CD9 looks a little like shape of Sorting Hat from Harry Potter. Put our towns cities comm back together.

"One of the most basic parts of our community life is the schools our children attend. As a parent of three children, I know that the schools they attend and the parents in those schools become a community. The school provides educational and extracurricular activities for my children, which then feeds into their social lives. Then the parents of my children's friends become my social circle. As a community, we work together for the common good for our children and their interests. With a school district as the heart of our LD, a natural community forms and we are able to work towards common goals as a group. Splitting a school district splits communities of children and parents who woud naturally desire to work together as a unit. n"
We are rural community. PPL are separated on acre lots and do not know one another very well. We have a couple parks relatively close but must have a vehicle to get around. No bus routes. Land is used for residential use only. We have many washes that are closed when it rains. It is not possible during floods to get out or get in through our roads. Most PPL speak English. No employers. Poor school district due to tax base. nRedistricting should encompass different economic and cultural groups. When you redistrict rich neighborhood by themselves it then becomes a political subdivision so to speak. It is where our State will place good polling places and drop boxes. We are privileged in one of those neighborhoods and it is not fair to others that also count just as much in our political arena. We need to mix rich with the poor so that our tax dollars are used for everyone and we all reap the goods of the dollars we invest. The school district is poor that we live in so these children are at a disadvantage due to the tax revenue. MIX THE RICH WITH THE POOR FOR A EQUAL OUTCOME!!!
"We love our Scottsdale community, but we feel that we are not represented by our state government.  LD23 is not a balanced district politically.  Rebalancing is critical for LD23 because 
1.  In AZ LD23, Republicans have a 20 point registration advantage.
2.  Only about 18% of registered Independents lean Democratic in LD23.
3.  The actual vote counts in the last several election cycles prove that competitiveness matters.n"
"It is of utmost importance that we protect the international trade route that has been taking place for the past 150 years. The produce industry depends on this corridor and the federal funding monies that flow to our communities as a result of this. On top of this, we have to ensure the protection of the tourism industry.  Arizona receives billions of dollars in tourism every year.nWe can not allow the imposition of the  religious beliefs of a small group of people drive the economy, the politics and the health of our state. This is primitive! Look what the politicization of Covid-19 is doing to our country, this is no longer a matter of religious preference but a matte of life and death. Religion has no place in the public arena of politics ."
"I live in the foothills near Sabino Canyon; Tucson and Pima County are my community of interest because I spend much of my time outside my immediate neighborhood- downtown Tucson’ theaters and museums, places like Sweetwater and Catalina State Park, taking visitors to the Desert Museum and San Javier Del Bac, mobile meals to Picture Rock.
Tucson has retirees, military personnel, academics, tourism employees; Latinos, African and Native Americans, and Whites. We are connected by our appreciation of nature, our multi-cultural heritage and many have bonds to the U of A, 
Because we are spread out, we need better roads.  We need job development and better funding for public schools.
We share environmental concerns because we enjoy outdoor activities and our tourism industry depends on the natural beauty of the area.  Wild fires and drought are often problems.
Because we are diverse, we need at least 2 CDs representing us and they must be competitive.  LD9 is fairly drawn and competitive.n"
"Tucson, in Pima County, is well represented by people who take care of its diverse communities. We want to see this retained by competitive districts that include strong representation from our indigenous and communities of color.
We have been successful in Pima County and Tucson in creating fair, competitive congressional and legislative districts and the Arizona voters put this independent redistricting commission in place to ensure fair map drawing that is not gerrymandered to favor one party or constituency over another. We are entrusting you to ensure this continues. The Gadsden Purchase in 1853-1854 made the indigenous and Latinx community the epitome of ""we did not cross the border, the border crossed us"". Do not seek to disenfranchise it.nMy neighbors have been my neighbors for over 50 years because I purchased the home next door to my parents. I am not alone in this distinction. Many of us have chosen to live close to our aging parents for logistical as well as cultural reasons. It is disheartening to watch people who have moved to Arizona attempt to dictate to those of us who have roots that stretch back to when this country was indigenous. The geographical area in which Tucson is located has been populated since 8000B.C. Europeans claimed the area as New Spain for 300 years, from 1521 until the declaration of Mexican independence in 1821. This area was then Mexico for about 30 years, until the 1850s, when it became a United States Territory. Arizona itself did not become the 48th state until 1912, almost 110 years ago.  We know who we are, we know what we like, and we will be neither ignored nor neglected."
"AZ LD23, along with many other LDs, is demographically extremely weighted towards Republicans.  In fact, LD23 Republicans hold a 20 point advantage in registration over Democrats.

Some may argue that Party Registration should not be a criteria in redistributing considerations.

Here are some factors to take in consideration to rebuff that argument for all Districts:

By holding such a large registration advantage, there is little to no competitiveness in local Representative and Senate Races.  The Party holding such a huge registration advantage has no incentive to explain their points of view, nor any incentive to listen to the opposing side.  During election cycles, they have continually declined to debate their opponents because they don’t have to worry about shifting votes.  They have a clear and unbeatable advantage.nIf districts were grouped in a more equitable Registration boundary, constituents in that district would be better served by their representatives, regardless of party.  There would be more incentive for candidates to listen to their constituents, if there was a closer gap in Registration. 

Don’t we all want to live in an area in which we feel that our point of view is at least considered?  In my District, Representatives from both the House and Senate BLOCK constituents from communicating with them on their Social Media platforms: not due to foul behavior.  We are blocked simply because we belong to the opposing Party.  If Registration by Party was closer in my district, my representatives would not be able to just throw my point of view and my vote away.  But because they hold such a huge gap in Registration, there is no need to listen to the opposing side at all.

Please take Registration gaps into consideration when configuring the new district maps.

Respectfully,
Michael Kasen"
This community is tied through common interests within the Kyrene School District. We share issues and concerns that should be tied together when considering representation in office. n
"Hello,

I am writing into ask that the Kyrene School district is retained within LD18. As a graduate from both Kyrene and subsuquent Tempe Union High School District, the community within that district need to be properly represented and I believe that is currently being done. The district the way it is currently mapped has been successful and resulted in accurate representation I don't believe changes are needed at this time.n"
"I consider my community to be more urban and part of greater Tucson.  I subscribe to the Daily Star, use the internet services of Pima county, travel into Tucson for doctors, shopping, entertainment, culture, and restaurants offering diverse food selections.  I own no livestock, grow no crops and use the supermarkets, farm markets, etc.  to support those who do.  They happen to be east and south toward Tucson.  To experience Tucson and it's growing diversity, Tucson Meet Yourself says it best,  My religious affiliation is also in the city of greater Tucson.  I support small, independent business, also in Tucson.  Marana and Oro Valley share the same developmental issues, offer shopping and, are in close in proximity to Tucson and I travel there for both friendship and activities.  My zip code reflects Pinal County but if I want to sell my house it is listed as being in Tucson.  I moved to Tucson and reside in Pima county.  nMy voting record speaks for itself and I have not be represented ever in this current district.  My representatives share none of my growing concerns about low health care funding, poor air quality, high crime rates, lack of funding for public education, tax structures that will break the state like it did in Kansas.  We also rank 30 in business . These issues were cited in the CNBC report of July 21, 2021.  This beautiful state deserves better, I deserve better."

"I live in the foothills.  My community includes the city of Tucson. My community is diverse and includes different cultures and economic levels.  In the limited make-up of the foothills we depend on the diversity of Tucson to survive as a community. We share access to medical facilities,cultural venues and recreational places. The UofA and downtown are important parts of my community. My community also includes Davis Monthan, Raytheon, Amazon and the business of astronomy. We are all concerned about water issues.  Public transportation will become more important as the main mode of transportation. People gather and socialize in events downtown, the UofA, at public exercise places like parks, The Loop, churches and restaurants including Mexican and other international cuisine.nBecause my community is diverse it’s important that my district remain competitive.  Diverse and competitive districts give us better representation. Boundaries should include a diverse population to protect and enhance the voting power of communities of color and to protect against extremism."

"I was not very good at drawing my community of interest but I would like to emphasize that Green Valley has a tremendous amount in common with the locations south, east and west of Tucson and with Tucson as well.  I do not believe we have much in common with the communities north of Tucson so do not recommend being included with them.  Residents of Green Valley shop in Tucson, celebrate cultural events in Tucson and throughout the southern part of the state, and many speak or learn to speak Spanish so we can engage with our friends who go back and forth to Mexico and who are a vibrant part of our culture - as they are in Tucson.  Our land use issues are connected as is our tourism economy.  Please connect us with people who are our neighbors and who share our interests and concerns - and not with those north of Tucson who, in many cases, have little or no idea of who we are and how we live, work, and play.

"We are an ethnically diverse community suburban in nature. We are not farmers, ranchers, miners or dairies. The largest employer in the area is Fort Huachuca and the community supports the servicemen, civil servants and contractors who work there. The Sierra Vista/ Hereford community is the largest concentration of people in Cochise County and we have more in common with Southeast Tucson than with farmers and ranchers in the more rural areas.  Furthermore we outnumber them by far.  We sport a mall, a community college, a branch of the U of A, and a large number of military retirees and outdoors types with a large birding community. The birders help support many businesses in the area such as motels, restaurants and shops. Much of the work in the area is high tech with computer experts, intel experts, communications folks and similar occupations in high demand. We want fair immigration laws but are not feeling threatened by proximity to the border. We welcome our diversity.

"Patagonia, Sonoita , ElginnCOMMENTS TO IRC

Patagonia/Sonoita/Elgin is a unique community which over the years has become home to all manner of social, environmental and artistic efforts.  It is unique among the smaller Arizona communities and its efforts have been supplemented and supported by  Santa Cruz County , both in terms of preserving its natural charm, and resisting  efforts to exploit our local  resources for commercial gain.

The same is not true of Cochise County
.
While the benefits of a merger with Cochise and Santa Cruz counties remain elusive and unproven, the downside is clear and immediate.   Their interests are not our interests  - and I urge you to keep the current legislative district intact as it has served us well.

"All voices on all sides of any issue should have a right to express their preferences through the voting process. This is not possible when a district is drawn so that one side will win any vote on any issue, just becasue the district was intentionally drawn to include more of that population and exclude the opposing population. When this is the case, politicians begin to feel that they can do anything they want without accountability.
Please support fair and equitable redistricting. Living in LD23 should not mean that my vote never has a chance of counting!n"
"This neighborhood is characterized by traditional ranch housing, diversity, interest in historic preservation and quality of life.

I've lived in Arizona more 50 years and Scottsdale for more than 40 years. I live in a designated historic district and am block watch captain and live within 5 miles of medical facilities, shopping, the post office and schools. It is important to me that redistricting be competitive as mandated by voters because Arizona is a competitive state. The changing demographics of Arizona's growing population must be fairly represented. The new districts must protect, reflect and enhance the voting power of Arizona's growing communities of color.  Thanks again."
"LD23 is largely empty.  Areas that are populated are relatively affluent, except perhaps for the “boot heel” area in south Scottsdale.  It is a nice place to live.  LD 23 has had some increase in Democrat registration and turnout in the last several years, that has not been able to approach the heavy Republican presence in the LD.  Republican registration in LD 23 is nearly twice Democrat registration and only 18% of Independents are Democrat leaning.   I have lived here for 26 years and have never felt that LD Representatives represent me.  One of the current LD 23 legislators has  been in the legislature since 2011 and another since 2014.  Arizona is now pretty clearly a purple state, but with the overrepresentation of Republicans in the District, LD 23 is simply not competitive and is not representative of Arizona.  That tends to make my vote feel less important.  
Please consider the issue of competitiveness as you make new districts.nI would appreciate being able to go into elections feeling that my vote might make a difference rather than seeing it as likely useless in the face of the overwhelming registration imbalance in this district."
"I live just north west of the intersection at Stapley and Southern in Mesa.

I ran twice for the House of representatives in the last 10 years and many of my friend and associates who I worship with and my children and grandchildren go to school and worship with, were not able to support me in my endeavor because they are in a completely different district than I am. I have 8 children and 29 grandchildren and all but 3 of my grandchildren live in the Mesa Public school district.  And right now half of them are in one district and the rest are in another.

Many have come from elsewhere, and chose southern AZ to live because we value the same things: its history, geography, plant community, mountains and valleys - the environment in which we live.  We share a concern for our most precious resource: water.  We differ in our beliefs about how to keep the environment beautiful and keep the birds, plants and animals that comprise the area, but most have a commitment to making that happen.  We share a commitment to the people of Mexican and native American descent who were here before us.  Finally, as near-border residents, we all share concerns about how immigration is handled.n"
"Our community is diverse, mobile, and is the main driver of the economy in Coconino County. Our town is young, vibrant, and concerned about the way our state legislature is cutting off our voices through voting restrictions, tax cuts for the wealthy which leave our working class unable to find housing, and educational mandates which take local decisions away from our local leaders and puts them in the hands of reckless people in Phoenix. Honestly, I am glad many people can afford the luxury of a 2nd home ""cabin"" up in the pines with more square footage than my house where I am raising my family, but I do not think that type of luxury adds to our sense of community, and these people should not be considered as ""local voices"".

Same for my Congressional District 6 - even with all of the ethics issues exposed  and his lack of real outreach and discussion with everyone in his district - we cannot seem to be able to elect anyone that is moderate.   An independent has no chance of being heard nor represented let alone a Democrat.

Marana has more in common with Pima County than rural Pinal County.  Oro Valley has more in common with Pima County than rurual Pinal County.

The new mines owned by foreign companies in the Patagonia area will have an impact on water, roads and tourism for the district including Sonoita and Elgin.

"In 2020 I moved to Santa Cruz County from Maricopa County. My relocation was driven by the desire to live in this area because of its historical significance, beautiful natural resources and cultural diversity. I work remotely and can live anywhere I want in the world,  and I chose Tubac. 

The I-19 corridor communities of Tubac, Green Valley, Rio Rico, Nogales, Amado and beyond are a close knit group of people who represent all walks of life, including professionals, artists, retirees, produce workers, ranchers and farmers. We come from many different backgrounds and viewpoints but a share a common love for Santa Cruz County and what it represents.

The most vital thing we all share is our integral connection to Tucson and Pima County. We shop and dine in Tucson, we attend school there, we work there, and we rely on medical resources there. It only makes sense that Santa Cruz County and Pima County remain interconnected as we are now, and part of the same district.nIt would not be a benefit to Santa Cruz County residents in any way to change our district to be a part of Cochise, Maricopa, or any other county. Please do not change the boundaries only satisfy a small but vocal minority who desire change only to further their own nefarious agendas."

"The communities of Nogales, east to Patagonia and north to Tucson are tied together through business, culture and the arts.  The upgraded Highway 15 in Mexico to I 19 north promotes international trade.  The I 19 corridor and route 82 connect communities with common business, cultural and arts environments.

"Unable to work that map thing but please use my input as based on ALL of Tucson - within the City of Tucson and outside of the City limits.  There is a wide range of incomes from poverty to very affluent across this area.  We rely on large employers such as the U of A, city government and some large companies such as Raytheon for economic stability.  There is a vast number of family, small and medium sized businesses that also create economic stability and employment.  We need sound water management services and thoughtful long term thinking on the management of property to avoid Tucson becoming unsustainable and unlivable in the future.  The community should have a voice in property development and expansion.  We need clean, safe parks for families and community events.  There is an unusually high number of non profits serving people across a wide range of educational, mental health, financial and other needs; this is a positive response to high need in Tucson. nVoting should be made as convenient as possible for English speakers and speakers of other languages. Tucson is claiming its place as a popular destination, a reputation we should continue to build while keeping it an attractive place to raise a family, retire, study, enjoy the outdoors and have a career. There is a thriving arts, music and crafts community which makes Tucson special. The U of A makes a strong cultural contribution to the community with its activities. Sadly, crime is v high - breakins, thefts from cars, and robberies of stores. Tucson managed COVID precautions well and supported local businesses, particularly restaurants which are an important part of the economy and quality of life.

"Garden District residents still consider the Tucson Botanical Gardens, Martha Cooper Library, and John B.

Improving safety, stability of residents and quality of life is a priority.
Garden District has become known as a vibrant, active neighborhood.  Now we are recognized for our engaged residents, annual Porch Fest, community-wide yard sale, Holiday party at the Botanical Garden, Child-centered events, monthly crime meetings with police, five Little Free Libraries, a weekly e-newsletter, and twice a year plant swaps.nOver the years, residents wrote grants and worked hard to improve the appearance, safety, and quality of life in Garden District.  Major projects with far-reaching impacts were a grant for construction of sidewalks on both sides of Columbus and building the Pima Pedestrian Path by replacing a frontage road on Pima with sidewalks and vegetated water harvesting basins.  Other grants included: playground equipment for Wright, traffic calming roundabouts and speed tables, home repairs for low income residents, and hundreds of trees planted.  In 2011, Brad Holland donated a portion of his property at 1933 Bell to create a Community Garden."
"Hello, my name is Jon Luker. I have lived in Maricopa County, Arizona since I brought my family here from Northern California in 1990. My extended family, which includes 13 grandchildren is committed to this community. I'm testifying as a citizen of Gilbert, CD5, and LD12 now for 19 years.

My community consists of small business owners, high tech professionals (of which I am one), health care workers, and public servants. I was part of a wave that put my community on a national map of fastest growing municipalities in the nation and consistently ranks as a desirable place to live.

Gilbert is currently split between two legislative districts (LD12 and LD17). This is not conducive to communities of interest. In addition, LD12 is currently split between counties, with a small sliver of Pinal County included in the district. This is confusing and unfair, not reflecting a natural community divide.

Mexican Americans offer hospitality, and the food has made Tucson a Unesco site for gastronomy. Tohono O'odham and Pascua Yaqui tie us firmly to the land. Artists, writers, and musicians give us a cultural wealth hard to match. Dark skies make astronomy a primary driver of scientific development. I have heard the white, conservative, nationalist impulse that aims to draw district boundaries and am utterly appalled by the idea that the wealthy upper class, in their suburban enclaves, would cut out the festive, beautiful,  urban, artistic, educational center that is Tucson. As far as I can tell, it is a racist impulse and nothing more. Please keep us all together. nPlease remember justice for all--not just for some.

Population growth during the last decade has mainly been infill, our existing legislative boundaries have served us well, so new boundaries should be qualitatively similar to current ones.

"Santa Cruz County is an international bird watching and wine tourism region that is vitally dependent on environmental protection.  Cochise County elected officials have relentlessly supported development to the detriment of the area’s fragile habitat. Cochise legislators have no incentive to protect us against the Rosemont mine and other commercial development disasters which would destroy tourism in this area.  Sierra Vista is a community with no downtown and no heart; there is nothing there to draw us to it. There is a small group of local people in Sonoita/Elgin who have pushed for incorporation into Cochise County because they mistakenly think their taxes will be lower.  I do not believe their views are supported by the majority of the population, much of which has not even been aware of their efforts.nOne of the most important directives of the IRC is to, when possible, create competitive districts so that the make-up of our elected representatives will match the political make-up of our state.  Competitive districts tend to result in the success of more mainstream candidates instead of the fringe candidates who are elected in low turn-out primaries. Our current legislative district is overwhelmingly Democratic.  The majority of the Republicans in our district live in the Sonoita/Elgin area.  Cochise County already has a Republican majority.  Moving Sonoita/Elgin into the same legislative district with Cochise County would make both districts less competitive, not more.

The City of Maricopa is a family oriented community which hosts a number festivals and other community activities which afford us opportunities to get together with our neighbors. nI strongly urge the IRC to formulate its map based upon equal population as opposed to a map based based on solely or heavily on an equal geographical area which does not take in account the cultural, historical and economic interests of the City of Maricopa.  
More importantly, an equal population map would protect persons of color, ensure the aims of the Voting Rights Act are complied with and reflect the increase in diversity our City is currently experiencing.  If the aim of the IRC is to facilitate the inclusion of all folks in   participatory democratic processes, then the creation of maps with equal population as the basis for the creation of the redistricting maps, it will engender a sense that the citizens of our community will get to choose their representatives, and NOT the other way around."

Pinal County is more rural and has more agriculture and mining operations.  
It is my belief that since Tucson is nearing one million people that we should have two voting districts and that these districts should be closely related.

"Hello,
This is an older, established neighborhood with a diverse population. My immediate neighbors range from senior retirees to young working families. Mixed population of Mexican, white, and Cuban residents. It is now quiet after removal of drug addicts. So much better now.

There are new homes built after Loop 101 established. Referred to as cookie-cutter homes, all look the same. Improved economically, but boring to look at.

My immediate ""block"" is now mixture of mobile homes and new 'traditional' homes being built. This area is not burdened by an HOA, all are privately owned homes on lots. We are also horse properties, which I am grateful for and hope to remain in this unique zoning area.nI am appalled to the Republican comments from the downtown Phoenix meeting regarding gerrymandering to THEIR benefit. In reference, one individual wants the re-redistricting to be revised as east of SR 51. Does he believe anyone west of SR 51 is a  criminal, ignorant and/or unfit to vote citizenship? It was certainly implied.

I own my home. Have 1/2 acre  horse property. My neighbors have their own business and work hard for their families and homes. They also are Mexicans - who, by the way - take better care of their property than most of the rest of us. [Except for small children, property maintenance is not compatible just yet....]

Republicans were defeated in the last election as we in Arizona want to be progressive. They have begun a backwash of misinformation, statistical juggling, and indifference to Prop 106. They are attempting to overrule voting rights for people of color and ANYONE they consider unworthy to vote.

"The Santa Cruz River Valley has been the heart of this area for all of human history, and that includes the sky islands that surround it.

We attract visitors from across the nation and even the world, and form key cross-border cultural, economic, and environmental alliances. 
nPolicies that govern the highlands on both sides of the Santa Cruz River Valley need to reflect the importance of protecting habitat and surface water that supports both resident and migratory wildlife populations on which our eco-tourism depends.

We are diverse group and come from many cultural and political backgrounds, reflecting the diversity in Arizona. I moved to this state eight years ago because of its beauty and  the historic and cultural diversity that is around us. I appreciate living in my competitive District

 I am hoping that this Commission will uphold the promise of the Voting Rights Act and our maps will reflect the growing diversity of this state  in order to maintain the democratic process our country was founded on.

nArizona is divided into 3 Parties, Democratic, Independent, and Republican, each representing about one-third or our population. The maps must reflect and represent  the growing minorities that are living in this state. Several areas have a majority Latino population which needs to be heard from. There is also a significant Native American population, the first people living on this land, and their tribal boundaries need to be respected to allow them to have a voice in Arizona.

Elected officials should represent all of their constituents, not just a specific ""base"" of supporters. A competitive district protects against extremism in a candidate, and leads to bipartisan cooperation because  they must appeal to a broad group of people, giving voters a better selection in candidates.

"Yavapai County, including the City of Sedona should be one Community of Interest.  This area encompasses exclusively rural communities which have a lot of characteristics in common.  People in this community enjoy the out of doors, have similar neighborhoods, occupations, social and civic networks, parks, and churches.  They also share common land use and water issues.  Transit is comparable throughout the area mapped.  The only freeway impacting this COI is the I-17.  The historical traditions of this COI is very similar, going back to the days of the Earps.  The people are used to a slower pace, and not having major shopping available.  Water issues are important to all residents of this COI, and they impact almost everyone in this Community equally.  The people here are also subject to the same pressures for delivery of their food supplies.  It does not make sense for Sedona to be in two separate COIs, so including the entirety of Sedona in this COI makes perfect sense.nIncluding parts of Maricopa County in the COI makes very little sense, since residents there are more urban, have different traffic, food and water issues to deal with.  Population changes since the last redistricting in 2010 have increased the number of residents in these rural areas.  Thus, including parts of Maricopa County in this COI to provide a higher population count, should not be necessary.  In addition, adding the half of Sedona that is in Coconino County will increase the numbers in this COI sufficiently to make the map drawn above work to satisfy all of the criteria that the Commission needs to consider.  Politicians representing the COI mapped above would have a reasonable travel distance, and they can adequately represent the interests of their constituents with this homogeneous rural population.

We have people who I believe would like to live and work in this area but it is not walkable.

"I live in a wonderfully diverse community (currently LD10) that spans from the Civano neighborhood to the University of Arizona. People work for major employers, including University of Arizona, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Raytheon and many small businesses. We share the same transportation corridors, schools, parks and shopping centers. I have canvassed this area for state legislative candidates for about 25 years. This is a very competitive district that reflects Arizona's population and should be replicated as much as possible to reflect the state's electorate. The many Independents are swing voters who support candidates who reflect moderation, something Arizona could use, particularly as we face difficult decisions about how to grow our state in the face of climate change  - water issues, heat islands, forest fires - all require moderate voices that will keep our state habitable long into the future. Education funding and road conditions are other big concerns here, too.nI ask the IRC to live up to the expectations set by voters who established the IRC in 2000: create legislative districts that reflect the Arizona electorate. Given that 1/3 of voters are Independents, recognize that Arizona is a moderate state. Independent registration has grown by 52,941voters since Nov. 2020, while Republican registration has dropped 8,916 and Democrats are down 3,784. Every year after the legislature adjourns, voters run petition drives to get initiatives on the ballot to overturn radical legislation that voters didn't want. Currently we have 3 petitions to overturn legislation on voting rights and 3 dealing with education funding.  We have irresponsible laws that hinder public health policies during a deadly pandemic. We need legislative districts that will elect moderate leaders who reflect Arizona and provide a more efficient, competitive, diverse way of governing. Lastly, ensure communities of color have adequate representation."

"Eastern Marana has very close ties to NW Tucson. There are many services not available in Marana or Oro Valley that we rely on NW Tucson for. I am speaking up because I listened to the Sunday Aug 8 meeting and felt that many speakers painted Marana with too broad a brush. We are not at all tied to the military, as several people alluded to. It is mostly assorted retirees and families with small children who attend the new STEM schools in the area. Currently we are pushed in with Pinal County, but their interests are more rural, and it doesn't make sense for us.n"
"The Yavapai Apache nation includes inhabited land in Clarkdale, Camp Verde and Rimrock plus land with uninhabited sacred sites near Sedona and  Camp Verde. All of this land is in the Verde Valley. There are five distinct living communities Tunlii, Middle Verde, Camp Verde, Rimrock, and Clarkdale along the Verde River and its Beaver Creek confluence. The communities share the heritage of the Yavapai and Apache people, who were the first nations communities that lived here before euro-american settlers arrived. The forced march of 1876 dislocated the Yavapai and Apache from their traditional lands along the Verde River until their return at the beginning of the 20th century.

Today the five communities share a health care system, a common relationship with the federal government and housing and transit system. Language, culture and history continue to define us as a community.

It is important that our community be in a district that includes the Verde Valley and the Navajo Nation.nThe ancestral homelands of the Yavapai Apache nation include Flagstaff which was traditionally a place of trade and continues to be the major city of reference for our region.

It is also important to us to be in a district with a significant population of indigenous americans so that issues common to us, like health care, federal correspondence, education, and land  and water usage can be met with a common voice. 

We have a distinct familial and clan relationship with the San Carlos/White Mountain and Tonto Apache. We should be in a district together.

Our current community is divided between legislative and congressional districts and it would make sense for our distinct Verde Valley community of interest to be in one congressional district with our relatives and allies in the Navajo nation and San Carlos/White Mountain and Tonto Apache nation so we can amplify the power of our indigenous voices.

The map drawn outlines the five residential areas of our nation + sacred lands."
"My family and I moved here 4 years ago for my husband's work.  We live in South Gilbert near Chandler Heights Rd. west of Power Rd.  His job was in Mesa, but we specifically chose Gilbert (in LD12 and CD5) because of the depth and breadth of educational offerings in the Chandler Unified School District.  My community of interest includes families w/school age children, that understand and appreciate the values that our neighborhood school education offers.
At present, my elected officials do not represent my values and interests in supporting and fully funding public education.  I would like my new LD and CD to include the geographic location defined by the CUSD school boundaries (mapped above) bounded by Hunt Hwy and Warner Rd, Price Rd and Sossaman, though not in a perfect square.  This community values and includes neighborhood schools and understands that they are the anchor of the neighborhood, the glue that holds the neighborhood and society together.nOur neighborhood schools provide continuity of friendships for our kids as they move through the public school system.  They serve as the meeting place for afterschool activities, sporting events, and more.  My COI also includes family households in neighborhoods, with common community identity, lifestyles, and goals.  

I respectfully ask that the period of submission for the COI and mapping tool be extended until mid-Sept. when the grid maps are scheduled to be released, offering additional time for public comment and submissions.  Outreach to the communities and stakeholders and parties of interest (black communities, Asian communities, Latinx communities, Native American communities, etc.,) and including translators for those populations to actively include their input as valued members of our population."
"I live in Oro Valley.  Oro Valley, Marana and Tucson are urban communities comprised of working class people and retirees.  Oro Valley and Marana have large areas represented by an HOA.  We get our news from Tuscon and use Tucson for entertainment, shopping, dining.  I have no need to go into Pinal County except to drive through it.  Pinal County is more rural with agricultural and mining operations.  
Since Tucson is nearing one million people I believe that the Tucson region should have two voting districts.  The districts should be closely related.  Pinal County does not relate to us so we should be disassociated from Pinal County.  We should be voting with people with like minds.

"We are an historically agrarian part of SE Santa Cruz County. Cattle ranching and vineyards use the majority of the acreage and contribute to the economy of all of SE Sonoita Cruz CountynIt seems as if some of our neighbors believe the ""grass is greener on the other side"". There is no logic and no real economic benefit for NE Santa Cruz County becoming part of Cochise County. The tax base of the adjoining area of Cochise County would be increased by the addition of the properties in SCC, but that change has not been demonstrated to reduce anyone's taxes which is the thrust of this movement. We are already 45 minutes from our County seat and joining Cochise County would result in us being even further away (from Bisbee). I have looked at most everything this group has made public and I cannot convince myself there is any merit to their proposal. This idea should die on the vine and disintegrate into the past."

nOne of the most important directives of the IRC is to, when possible, create competitive districts so that the make-up of our elected representatives will match the political make-up of our state.  Competitive districts tend to result in the success of more mainstream candidates instead of the fringe candidates who are elected in low turn-out primaries. Our current legislative district is overwhelmingly Democratic.  Most of the Republicans in our district live in the Sonoita/Elgin area.  Cochise County is already majority Republican.  Moving Sonoita/Elgin (and Patagonia?) into the same legislative district with Cochise County will make both districts less competitive, not more.  Please leave our current legislative district intact as our representatives have served us well.  Thank you.

"My COI is Tucson in Catalina Foothills. One of the most affluent communities in AZ & US. Heavily populated with retirees, residents value privacy & natural environment with proximity to Mt. Lemmon, nationally recognized resorts & spas, unique blend of cultural, literary and performing arts, upscale shopping and ethnic and fine dining. 
Tucson is the second largest city in the state. We enjoy the benefits of city living including city water and sewer services, good paying jobs, access to affordable healthcare and high quality public education including the U of A, satellite campuses of ASU and NAU and Pima College. 
We value access to the VA Healthcare System and access to Davis-Monthan AFB.
Residents do not pay city taxes but fund their own fire districts. This area is represented at the local level by our Pima County Supervisor. Recently Tucson City Council voted to charge more for city water specifically Catalina Foothills. Ironically, this area has resisted annexation for decades.
nNeighborhood is age, gender & ethnically diverse. We count retirees & working-age folks with children, snowbirds, white & blue collar professionals, large & small business owners as neighbors.
The Foothills area has a distinct identity, compact, contiguous & geographically whole. To comply with the population & VRA requirements a map must include areas of greater Tucson. The challenge & my ask is that you keep the Cat Foothills as whole as possible.
The population and economic base of Tucson is so significant in this state, So AZ requires 2 Congressional districts to adequately represent the interests of the area. So  Arizona must maintain current # of legis districts  
Residents of this area need competitive representation at local, state & federal level  Issues that can’t be managed w/o governmental action include safe & secure water supply, broadband & transportation, adequate & affordable healthcare, quality public education, sustainable, carbon-free energy generation & supply"

"Sedona is located within both Yavapai and Coconino counties.  As such, I  utilize the medical facilities of the  Verde Valley which sometimes also requires me to go to Flagstaff.

"My Community of Interest includes the contiguous area of Marana, Oro Valley, Catalina, Eagle Crest Ranch, Saddlebrook, and Saddlebrook Ranch.

This is where we work, dine, shop, worship, receive medical services, and enjoy recreational activities.

Tucson does NOT offer the same activities we enjoy in our community of interest. Tucson has made it clear they are more interested in communities of race rather than diverse communities of interest, which is very concerning.

We also do very little anywhere north of our community of interest. It makes no sense for Congressional District 1 to extend several hundred miles from north Tucson to the Arizona/Utah border.  The current boundaries do not comply with the Arizona  Constitutional Provisions C and D because they are not geographically compact and do not “respect communities of interest to the event practicable.”nLegislative Districts (LDs) should be competitive; however, that is NOT the current situation. In five Legislative Districts there are over 87,000 more Democrats than Republicans.  For example, Democrats exceeds the number of Republicans by 12,000 in LD2; by 34,000 in LD3; by 6,000 in LD4; by 20,000 in LD9; and by 15,000 in LD10. The boundaries on the current maps DO NOT provide all parties a competitive chance. This does not comply with Constitutional Provision F which states “to the extent practicable, competitive districts should be favored where to do so would create no significant determent to the other goals.”  

I am not suggesting gerrymandering.  Districts should contain communities of interest that share the same principles and values.  Keep Arizonans together that value the same things such as the obeying and upholding the rule of law, adhering to the United States Constitution, and doing what is right for the state of Arizona regardless of political affiliation."

"I live in the community of Green Valley, AZ, about 25 minutes south of Tucson.  In some ways we are a very diverse community because residents have come from all over the US and Canada to vacation or retire here. But we share some very common characteristics because of similar needs for health care, transportation, and shopping.  Some residents are on limited incomes.  Many depend only on Social Security retirement funds.
Green Valley is not a town, but a collection of Home Owner Associations (HOA’s).

Residents of Green Valley vote. We are part of CD2 and LD2.  We need to have competitive districts so that we will feel we are being represented in the Federal, State & local elections. In the last election, more than 80% of the residents cast ballots.  We have about an even balance of Republican, Democrat and Independent voters.  

We share medical & shopping opportunities with both Sahuarita and Tucson.  We depend on being able to access many of the medical specialists in Tucson.nOur major needs are access to good medical care, reasonably close grocery shopping, and public transportation to reach doctors and medical facilities.  Other needs include reasonable costs for utilities, recreational activities for active and not-so-active adults and parks and picnic areas.

One of the main industries in Green Valley is serving tourists who spend the winter months.  The population doubles in January, February and March.
Our drinking water is supplied by several private drinking water companies who draw water from local aquifers and I understand that overall they are drawing out more water than is being recharged so eventually we will need to seek other supplies.  
 I believe there are some steps being taken to eventually bring water from the Central Arizona Project down the Santa Cruz Valley, but it will be quite expensive to provide the infrastructure necessary for transport and treatment."

The district covers the Yaqui and Tohono O’Odham nations in Pima County, portions of the Tucson Mountains and Ironwood Forest on the west and northwest side. The border of this voting rights district goes west to the California border to include the Hispanic border community of San Luis and its northern Hispanic community of Somerton up to southern Yuma to be inclusive of majority Hispanic neighborhoods in the City of Yuma.nThe Hispanic population in Southern Arizona have grown significantly and as we await detailed data from the US Census Bureau we want to begin to make our case for this Hispanic Voting Rights Act district 's population coming from Southern Arizona.

Please help keep our district small and compact so it represents all who live in it. I strongly believe it is important for the commission to follow the Constitution by adhering to all six of its criteria for Designation Boundaries."
"Patagonia is an international bird watching and eco- tourism region that is vitally dependent on environmental protection.  Cochise County elected officials have relentlessly supported development to the detriment of our fragile habitat.  I have no faith in the Cochise legislators to protect us against the mining activities of South 32  and other developmental disasters which would destroy both industries.  Sierra Vista offers nothing to draw us to it.  We are dependent on Tucson for shopping, medical care and leisure activities.  There is a well organized but small group of locals from Sonoita/Elgin who have pushed for incorporation into Cochise County because they mistakenly think the taxes will be lower.  I do not believe they are supported by the majority of the population, much of which has not even been aware of their efforts.n  I ask you to leave our current legislative district intact as our representatives have served us well."
"The Patagonia/Sonoita/Elgin region is an international bird watching, recreation tourism and wine tourism region that is vitally dependent on environmental protection.  We have found kindred spirits in our current district and do not wish to be lumped into the Cochise Distirct cohort.  Please leave us in our current district make up.  The adjacent district would be determental to our quality of life.

The greater Patagonia area is my home and it is an eclectic community made up of various ethnicities, education levels, socio-economics and political leanings.  Though there is often spirited debate we largely come together on most issues and often find we are closer alike that not alike.  Our elected officials largely reflect the diverse nature of our community.

Conversely, Cochise County elected officials have relentlessly supported development, any development, to the detriment of our fragile environment that knows no boundaries.   This is reflected by their state legislators.  


nPatagonia/Sonoita/Elgin region against the Rosemont mine and other developmental issues that include possible multiple mines.  We need a rigorous public involvement process to make sure that any mining is forced to meet the highest environmental standards.  All developmental processes, not just mining, are always improved by a rigorous public process whether at the local, state of federal level.  I do not see support for public invomet in that neighboring district.  

There appears to be a well-organized but small group of locals from Sonoita/Elgin who have pushed for incorporation into Cochise County because they mistakenly think the taxes will be lower and services will be better.  I do not believe they are supported by the majority of the population, many of whom are not aware of their efforts.  Further the residents of the greater Patagonia area have been well represented by the current democratic leaning leaderships.  

Please leave us in our our current districts makeup.

"This area is commonly considered by the residents to be the Quad Cities. I add Mayer into the mix as it is located on the Hwy 69 corridor along with Prescott, Prescott Valley, Dewey-Humbolt, and Chino Valley.  These communities are connected in many ways. Transporation being only one. Also, they are connected by the issues of water as they are interconnected by their supply of groundwater. The State of Arizona even considers them an entity in their Active Management Area with regard to the water source. 
Additionally, the area is tied together in a geographic sense as there is a border along the eastern boundary which is called Mingus Mountain, more correctly though, the Black Hills which stretch from just north of Cordes Junction to the Verde River.nI recall just after the turn of the new century having a conversation with my Cousin from out of state regarding the politics of Arizona in general. He mentioned that Arizona was to his way of thinking looking to be very forward-thinking as they had just passed the Independent Redistricting Program. It gave me a feeling of pride to think that our State was doing something so right and fair-minded.  I would simply like to have the IRC create a map so that the districts that are FAIR AND COMPETITIVE so all residents of the state can be proud of the results now and for the next decade."
"LD10 is a diverse district, composed of many ethnic groups, multiple religious interests, young families, working families and retired citizens.  Academics, medical professionals, military and veterans, government employees, business owners, and citizens living on social security.  We have hospitals, banks, businesses, schools, parks, libraries, malls in the center of Tucson, on the border of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.  

This diversity is reflected in the fact that LD10 is competitive and has elected people of both parties to offices in federal, state and local elections.nWe need diversity of opinions to best inform our local, state and federal representatives.  Diversity brings a richness to the table, ideas that are not available when listening to others of the same ideology.  When all voices are heard, there is greater support for issues which translates into strength.

Please draw maps that are representative of the diverse populations in our cities and state to allow for competitive elections that reflect the opinions of ALL the citizens of this state."

"Greetings, and many thanks to you for agreeing to volunteer for the difficult redistricting task ahead. The Islands Subdivision is governed by one inclusive HOA for the entire subdivision, and a number of smaller HOAs, for the many subsections within it.  The community as a whole enjoys lakes interwoven throughout the subdivision, with walkways and parks connecting its residents.  The Islands includes a unique blend of homeowners, ranging from owners of over 35 years, to young families, who find both, the schools, and the comradery from other young parents, as vital support systems for their children. I have witnessed a growing diversity among the residents, which adds value to the experiences of all who live here.  In addition, The Islands Community hosts a variety of events for its residents, with one most notably open to the public called ""The Christmas Boat Parade.""  In The Islands, there is a unique quality of life through shared spaces and social opportunities.nAs a resident of AZ for 20+ years, and a homeowner in The Islands subdivision in the Gilbert community, I have witnessed two welcomed changes: (1) the opportunity to communicate with you today as allowed by the passing of Prop 106, and (2) the competitive nature of my current district, as evidenced by bipartisan representation. Here, political races are won and lost on the merit of a candidate, not uneven political-party representation of its constituents.  In addition, candidates must work for votes and earn them, regardless of party affiliation.  As a voter, this means “my voice” can be heard through my vote. Certainly, many Arizonans, like myself, see more value in their vote when this kind of competition is evident. That is why I respectfully request and encourage the Commission to focus unwaveringly on the will of Arizonans by ensuring fair and competitive districts.  Many thanks in advance for your service to our state and for bearing the weight of this challenge."
"Simply put, the community I have drawn is a portion of Phoenix's East Valley suburbs, solely located in Maricopa County, sharing common High School, Elementary school, and Justice districts.  We have a common interest in voicing our opinions and concerns with the major traffic arteries that serve this area including the I-10,and SRs 60, 101, 202, ensuring that decisions made to one artery do not adversely impact the conditions of another.nThe reason for my submission is that I have heard that some are attempting to sell Maricopa and Phoenix's Ahwatukee as a community of interest which is utter hogwash since there is literally nothing in common with those two communities other than the fact that they are truly distinct communities within themselves in Arizona.  The city of Maricopa shares no school districts, no justice districts and is not even in the same county as Ahwatukee.  The community that is drawn above is compact and contiguous, consistent with natural (South Mountain), manmade (traffic arteries) and political boundaries (Phoenix/Guadalupe city lines)."
"Our community should include the Santa Cruz river valley communities, as we have common environmental interests, interests in dark skies, interests in natural area such as Madera Canyon, Saguaro Park, etc.  We share more interests with Tucson rather than more northern communities.

"LD 23 should include all of Scottsdale and Fountain Hills. These two cities share services, activities, parks, land use issues, etc.  The McDowell Mountian Preserve runs through both Scottsdale and Fountain Hills. We have nothing in common with the areas that LD23 currently includes. Those areas are lower density and don't have the same growth or requirements that larger cities have.

Additionally, LD23 is not a competitive district. It is predominantly Republicans who have a 20% registration advantage. Hardly a fair representation.

I strongly recommend the map be redrawn to EXCLUDE all other areas except Scottsdale and Fountain Hills.n"
"My COI Lies along the i-17 corridor from Anthem to Bell Road, West to 43rd Ave and East to 7th St.  All of our shopping, grocery stores, schools fall in this area. I also sing in ProMusica Arizona Chorus and rehearse weekly at a Presbyterian Church on 15th Ave and Beardsley.  The majority of my friends and neighbors also  frequent these areas for their needs. My COI is  suburban in nature. I would like to be in an LD that reflects that as a whole.  We shop, eat out, and have health resources in this area. The North Valley is growing by leaps and bounds. A large semi-conductor facility will be adding many new jobs in our area within four years. This will bring in more middle and upper middle class jobs and continue to expand our suburban area and lifestyle.nAnthem was lumped into LD1 in another county and is represented by three people from Prescott, more than an hour away in a different basically rural county.
We have nothing in common with Yavapai County and Prescott. I’ve only gone there twice in 22 years as a tourist to a quaint historic tourist town now trending to an older retirement age population.

The average age in Anthem is 43 years old. We moved to Anthem to ensure we would be around all ages as we grew older. Now the majority of my suburban COI is mainly working families based along the I-17 Corridor from Anthem to Bell Road, East to Cave Creek, and West to 43 Avenue.  Our school district is Deer Valley Unified that serves all of this area. The hundreds of thousands of people who moved here in the last two decades are very diverse: in age, in race, in religion, in backgrounds and politics—- They are from all over the country.  Yavapai County does not represent that at all and are set on preserving their rural way of life."

We have multiple High Schools and lower level schools in this are and want to have a voice in how they are financed. The 202 and 101 hwys are critical to our transport, so, we want to have a voice in the upkeep. This area is rich in mixed races that all need to have their voices heard. We are the working class and it is important that everyone has a voice and a vote in order to have a say in how our community exists and thrives.nPlease make sure that these maps reflect the diversity of Arizona. I would like to ensure that lines are drawn to reflect our AZ Electorate.  We are a purple state with 1/3 of our voters Independent. Our lines should protect against extremism, encourage bipartisan cooperation, and ensure that elected officials listen to all constituent communities. This will benefit response of representatives to our concerns. You have taken on a very serious and difficult position in assuring that our District lines are drawn in a fair and plausible fashion. I am concerned that there will be gerrymandering which will not reflect the diversity of our state and allow the majority vote to determine the future of the state of Arizona.  Thank you for taking on this serious task. Please be fair and determine the lines by population numbers and not party votes.  Thank You"
"My husband and I moved here to be near his elderly mom. We genuinely enjoy our immediate neighborhood and the surrounding area.  The business community in Green Valley and Sahuarita is wonderful. We love hiking in the Santa Ritas, volunteering at the Green Valley Animal League, working on environmental issues (like protecting the Santa Cruz River watershed), buying meat from local ranchers, visiting my husband's mom in Green Valley, and exploring neighboring towns, like Tubac, Nogales, Patagonia, Rio Rico, and the culinary heritage trail up in southern Tucson (including excellent taco stands and local bakeries).  We are grateful to have good community colleges and hospitals nearby, just up and down I-19.  I particularly like the mix of rural and urban in my area.  Being exposed to a deeper, richer Hispanic and Native American culture is new for me and I am enjoying it enormously, particularly places like the Missions at San Xavier del Bac and San Jose de Tumacacori.nI have always been a moderate.  I have watched with dismay the growth of extremism in our political system and I want, very much, to return to a place where I can vote for moderate candidates of either party.  Arizona is a purple state.  As it continues to grow,  we desperately need moderate candidates who are willing to reach across party lines and represent  ALL of their constituents - not just their base.  The only way I can see that happening is if districts are as competitive as humanly possible.  I was so impressed when I first moved here and learned about Arizona's IRC.  To my mind, there are few greater threats to our democracy than gerrymandering and carving out districts that are a lock for one particular party. To the extent possible, when you draw your boundaries, please keep Arizona competitive, moderate, and able to represent all of our communities, particularly Hispanic and Native American communities who have such a rich history in this area."

"My community of Interest is the Kyrene School District, an excelling school district that drew my family to this area 25 years ago. Given that this school district comprises many cities within its borders and is even split by an interstate, the sense of community we all share as ""Kyrene families"" all the more remarkable.  People say they ""live in Kyrene"" as the designator of THIS particular community. The KSD is the foundational structure of the community, and it has facilitated the a unique interdependence among the cities within it. Our families and students are, I feel, uniquely diverse, which creates an enriching and positive community.  As a West Chandler resident, my kids attended Kyrene schools in Tempe. Many parents are able to have their kids attend school nearer their workplaces through Kyrene's open enrollment. My family's work, school, and social lives have been centered in this KSD area. Our concerns and involvement rarely extend to areas of East or Southeast Chandler.nMy skill with this map drawing interface is poor; however, I would urge you to look at the boundaries of the Kyrene School District and do EVERYTHING you can to keep that together as a Community of Interest.  Because KSD allows open enrollment, any parent within Kyrene School District borders can petition to have their child attend ANY of the Kyrene district's elementary and middle schools, regardless of the city. Families from West Chandler, Ahwatukee, the Gila River Indian Community, and Tempe can all belong to the same school family.  Being part of KSD is the biggest linchpin in this community, and it fosters a unique relationship among families, neighborhoods, and cities, especially remarkable since it is split by an interstate. Families attending and the neighborhoods surrounding the schools  share concerns and issues. KSD is a uniquely diverse.  To assign LDs and CDs simply along city boundaries will split our Kyrene community. My COI is not the same as that of East Chandler."

"I am Stephen Roe Lewis, the Governor of the Gila River Indian Community (“Community”), which is a federally recognized Indian Tribe of over 22,000 tribal members, located near Phoenix, Arizona and within both Maricopa and Pinal counties. The Community is comprised of the Akimel O’otham and the Pee-Posh tribes and approximately 12,000 of these members live on the Reservation, which is roughly 372,000 acres and located in south central Arizona. The Reservation is divided into seven political districts with each district having representation on the Community Council based on the population of the district. Five districts are located in Pinal County and two districts are located in Maricopa County.nThe Community is also separated in two Arizona State Legislative Districts with representation from both urban and rural legislators. This representation suits the Community well, due to our geographical makeup and diverse population.  We would request that the Commission continue to allow Gila River Indian Community to be represented by both rural and urban interests at the state level.   In addition, we are currently in a rural congressional district. We firmly believe that our community, overall, has more in common at a federal level with rural communities due to our similar interest and issues.  For this reason, we are also requesting to continue to be placed in a rural congressional district.

The Community looks forward to continuing to work with our tribal, federal, state, and local partners to ensure that our Community members have representation that meet our diverse urban and rural geographic boundaries."

"My community covers a large swath of Arizona and my concern for my community is broader than even that. My community is not divided by partisan 'separatists' but, enjoined by the commonality of humanity and the knowledge that 'that which divides us, conquers us'. I understand that voting history and party registration are prohibited data points in this process. I implore you to continue in the direction that the IRC has followed by keeping our state gerrymander free.  
When it's done right, nonpartisan redistricting is a fantastic tool for counteracting disengagement, antagonism and polarization. Please do all you can to accomplish this ideal. Thank you.nI cannot say it any better than my friend and fellow Arizonan; ""If we carry the proposed belief-based drawing of districts to its extreme, I might note that I disagree with my neighbor about many policy issues, and could ask that my district be separated from his so that I will never have to endure having elected officials who disagree with me.  But this isn't the point. Communities of interest must have some geographic basis, not simply be manipulated to separate us because we don't agree.

More important to me than representing my political views is supporting this process: I want my fellow citizens to educate themselves and to care, because this is what benefits my ""community of interest"": my neighborhood, my city, my state, my country. When we marginalize voters by ensuring that their votes do not matter, my community, at all its scales, suffers.

-Tourism- I-17 corridor brings tourists heading for the Grand Canyon up through Sedona, Oak Creek Canyon, Cottonwood/Clarkdale and Flagstaff.n It is notable that Sedona is in two counties, but wants to be in the same legislative and congressional districts.

"As currently constituted, LD18 reflects the balanced, diverse, and competitive reality of today's Arizona. Current voter registration for LD18 stands at 56,000 Democrats, 52,000 Republicans, and 51,000 other. It is important to retain this competitive composition to protect against extremism and polarization.

"Doney Park is an area just to the north and east of the city of Flagstaff, just outside the city limits. It is made up of a number of differently named neighborhoods that share their relationship to the City of Flagstaff. Doney Park is a rural residential area, made up largely of properties measuring 2.5 acres each. Although we can find some groceries and fill up our gas tanks, or grab a bite to eat, at establishments spaced sporadically within our neighborhoods, we all depend upon Flagstaff for much required for daily life--groceries, auto repair, post office, clothing, household goods, etc. Currently, the Doney Park area is split into two different legislative districts--LD6 and LD7.  I recommend that the entire Doney Park area be included within a single district, that being the same district as the City of Flagstaff.  This would allow the whole of Doney Park to have a voice in issues raised at both the state and national levels.nIn addition, Flagstaff is one of a range of communities that share a distinctive reliance on the natural environment for their economic and social well-being, connected by their proximity to National Parks and National Forests. Here, in Northern Arizona, we rely on two major economic drivers: tourism and natural-resource-based sectors such as food production and recreation. Forest health, watershed protection, and fire management are crucial to the life and well-being of our people, our homes, and our jobs.  Northern Arizona communities that share these interests with Flagstaff include the Verde Valley, Sedona, and the Grand Canyon. Uniting these communities within one legislative district would give all these communities a voice in determining state and national policies on these shared concerns."

"What we call the Mountain (and nearby areas including White Mountain Apache Nation) is a rural area. Our COI extends over the whole state in all rural areas. We enjoy lower population density and, often, great natural surroundings, but we have the problems of rural areas: bad or non-existent internet access; costs of travel to spread-out places, some of which are necessary for us to reach, like hospitals; schools short on teachers, staff, money, infrastructure; roads in bad shape; threat of forest fires....I could go on. I don't see how you can address this through the redistricting process because if you make a district of just rural areas, it will be huge and weirdly-shaped, no doubt! I don't know the population figures but  I think rural areas don't have enough people per square mile to comprise an LD or CD and still be manageable size-wise while being compact. Keep us in mind, though. The city folk often don't think of how their plans and laws may affect us rural folk. Map is bad! n7/31 Show Low event: Three Navajo men asked after the mtg, ""What do they [most of the speakers] WANT?"" They want to be in a district which always elects who they want. After I came to AZ in 1975, I voted & voted and never got ""my"" person elected. Now, they are in that position. In any district anywhere, the minority may get someone they don't think represents them. In their case, however, their ideas get enacted in the Legislature. They said they were part of the Copper Corridor. What percentage of people on the Mountain and nearby is farmers, ranchers and miners? 5%? They don't want to be connected with the Navajo Nation which they see as a drain on their economy. I favor diversity and a way for Native Americans to have power in the government. I like current district setups except that the small parts of Native land, like the parts of WMAT in Gila and Apache counties, should be moved inside district boundaries with the rest of the tribe.

"The city of Phoenix is diverse in income, language, and ethnicity. The boundaries created in the last redistricting separated key communities of interest. For example, the black community in south Phoenix was divided at the City Council level and the legislative district diluted their impact and representation by including Tempe in LD27. The black community deserves representation and they aren't receiving it today. 

Additionally, in my district of LD28, I live in the northwest corner of the district near Lookout Mountain, which is a poorer community than Paradise Valley proper -- the wealthiest community in the district. My represents do not care about my community as we don't contribute to their financial elected interests. It would be better for us to be combined with the district west or north of Lookout Mountain.nI encourage the IRC to focus more on keeping communities of interest together rather than creating super-competitive districts. This hurt the voice of the people in our communities and separated communities that are united in income, values, and ethnicity."

Northern Pinal County is vastly different than eastern Maricopa County and the rest of Pinal County. We are not considered rural despite our demographics. We closely align with Gila County and Payson and work collaboratively as cities and counties. This drawing would encompass like minded demographics of people and ensure appropriate representation.n
"My name is Allison Hayes, and I am proud to have grown up in Patagonia Lake area for 16 of my 20 years. Sacred Heart of Jesus Parish in Nogales is where I was baptized and continue to participate at daily mass and community events. Besides the faith community, my community of interest is the agricultural and recreational areas of south eastern Arizona, such as Sonoita, which is home the the fairgrounds where I and countless other young people participate in 4H and FFA; the wineries and ranches throughout; our state parks, lakes (Patagonia, Parker, Pena Blanca, etc) and forests, which are a hub for fishing, hiking, and hanging out with friends and family. These points of interest, as well as our values, have much in common with the neighboring rural counties of Cochise, Greenlee and Graham. I believe it would be in our best interest as a community to be paired with communities with such similarities, and not a heavily populated primarily urban landscape such as South Tucson/Pima County.nWe would like representation that understands the needs and importance of our communities; at at this time, we're not feeling it. Thank you for your careful consideration! I tried my best to draw a map to illustrate what I wrote, but couldn't get it right, so I left it at that. Hopefully this description is enough to help you with your analysis!"
"Lina Hatch. We live in Gilbert 45 yrs, zip 85233

We have a Gilbert address, attend Gilbert schools, attend Gilbert church, we shop Gilbert,  healthcare in Gilbert, vote Gilbert town council, vote Gilbert school board, bank in Gilbert. 

In 2010 our area WEST OF COOPER AND SOUTH OF BASELINE was carved out of LD22 and placed in Chandler LD 17.  We do not belong, have no influence, no representation or cohesion. We do not associate with Chandler schools, churches, town council, school board, shopping, medical needs, bank, etc. We are divided from community of interest 10 yrs. 

By eliminating us from Gilbert district & drawing in southeastern area neither we who reside in Gilbert nor those drawn in were included in a cohesive community of interest and were not fairly represented. Cities should be kept as whole as possible. WE WANT OUR LD TO INCLUDE ALL OF GILBERT & KEEP OUR CITY WHOLE.

"Billions of dollars spent on produce traffic, international freight by rail and trucks, and tourism drove our economic base.  Nogales is home to an international airport as well.  Diversity of population and other demographics are closely knit with medical and educational opportunities in Tucson along this corridor.  A wide majority of Spanish speakers reside, work, attend religious services here.  Bilingual/bicultural events are what hold this community together, even through difficult economic struggles.  The Arts are prevalent in galleries, in public places and are popular with locals and visitors.  This connection with Tucson must continue. n"

This includes areas from Summerhaven, where I grew up spending weeks during the sunmer and my family has owned property, and lived full-time - Across to kitt peak where my Father-in-law worked for decades, and from Oracle to the North, where I frequently visit and purchase art,and attend retreats with family to Tubac where I weekend and shop. For outdoor lovers, hikers and bicyclists, our community is closely tied to the land and history -We love  the South sonoran desert region and desire to preserve its natural beauty and share with others who love it.nDemocracy only works when we talk to each other. Like minded bubbles make voters more extreme. We need political opponents -not enemies.That’s why I voted Yes in 2000:For Fair & COMPETITIVE Districts.
In 2020 I co-founded “Tucson Vote Riders” to take people to the polls as an antidote to polarization. We didn’t ask: Republican, Independent or Democrat? Just where do you live & when to come.It was a blast.
It’s thrilling to help folks get a voice- to vote.Most things aren’t fair, but in the US we believe we are equal before God and in the voting booth.But polarization in districts takes us away from this.
Polarization and extremism breed disgust & hatred for members of another party- as if we have nothing in common-as if other Americans are not quite human.This bothers me. It’s toxic to both our mental & electoral health.
I’m asking you to reduce extremism by making more competitive districts. I suspect candidates look at the other parties' voters more kindly when they need their votes."

"Pima County represents highly diverse interests and many shared values like education, racial equity, civic engagement , economic opportunity and a healthy environment. Tucson is home to a large VA hospital which serves the entire region.

 I have worked in education and community health and have friends and colleagues in all parts of Tucson, Green Valley, and smaller communities like Three Points Arizona. We all want to be able to access services and serve our communities.
My  LD reaches from west university to the Tucson Mountain area and into the southside.  My CD 3 encompasses a large Hispanic population and two tribal nations and ensures these voices are heard. Our three CDs in the county work together and represent a competitive and balanced landscape for the region, rural, suburban, and dense metropolitan areas alike. My state rep is accessible and service-oriented, such that we retain a small town feel within a large metro area.nMore young people are moving in and at the same time our state has always been a sanctuary for older people and that population is growing. 

Arizona is known for its climate and this is one area requiring representation to ensure communities have access to water and that southern Arizona can endure summers, far more scorching than those I experienced as a child. We have an opportunity to lead the way in climate solutions and age-friendly communities as long as our elected officials can fairly compete to prioritize this and the other shared values of our communities.

The people with whom I interact are diverse and want more unity, not a divided southern Arizona and state.  We must create districts that foster cooperation and represent this diversity.  This IRC serves a critical role; you are entrusted to ensure we remain compact, contiguous, competitive, and committed to our communities of color."
"Apache Wells began as a small city in Maricopa County that was annexed by Mesa in the late ‘80s.  It was founded as a retirement community, populated by snowbirds from the Midwest and some from Canada, but it has changed from seasonal more and more to year/round homes as the trailers have been upgraded.  There are several golf course communities in the boundaries I’ve drawn as well, so the character revolves around retirement and leisure, but there’s lots of retail and restaurant traffic, and services such as schools, churches, medical offices.  We also have some large employers and people who work at those jobs living in the area.  The residents have much in common and participate in the neighborhood garage sales, fundraisers and food shelves, as well as supporting local charities like Sunshine Acres orphanage.  It’s a thriving community that is becoming more diverse all the time.nAs I attended the community meeting I heard people asking you to draw boundaries so they would have a chance to elect representatives that they were more comfortable with—like where they came from.  I agree with the chairwoman pointing out that “competitive” districts are to be desired only if it makes sense with the other 5 criteria.  Redistributing should not be an Avenue to try to change the character of a state’s politics for the sake of that.  One woman said she was from New York and she was not comfortable with her representative.  From the words she used I could tell she meant she did not like living in an area that elected Republicans consistently.  I am sure she was very comfortable in New York, but she just moved to a very conservative state.  I loved living in Minnesota for years, but as a Republican I knew my vote would never turn that state “Red”.  However I did run for and win a seat on my local school board twice, and governed my values in a blue state."
"The Tohono O’odham Nation is a large reservation that is struggling with internet/transportation/housing and economic infrastructure. It is challenged by militarization of the border lands and a heavily border patrol presence. Residents of the Tohono O’odham Nation travel to Tucson frequently and there is a large population of tribal members who have relocated and now live in Tucson, South Tucson, Sahuarita, Three Points, Marana the surrounding areas. Our community is already being harmed by a lack of representation that allows for our issues to be dismissed. The majority of O’odham residents live in what is currently CD3. Tribal members contribute heavily to Tucson/S. Tucson and the surrounding areas that are named after adaptations of O’odham words/place names. Our influence in music, language and food show how ingrained our culture is even in the more populated/non-tribal lands area. Our food contribution helped Tucson win the distinction of being a UNESCO food city of gastronomy.nMembers of the Tohono O’odham (T.O.) community are concerned with the environment, education, economic opportunities, housing, the threat of the border wall,  preservation of culture and Native language, impact of militarization and healthcare. The T.O. Nation relies heavily on commuters from Tucson and the surrounding areas for its workforce in the “Capitol” which is Sells, Az, which is at the heart of the reservation, but which doesn’t accurately represent the more rural/dirt road villages that make up the area. Communication is most often transmitted using non-digital forms of communication. The Nation is heavily dependent on the use of paper flyers, the bi-weekly newspaper and the local radio station. The largest employer is the T.O. Nation, followed by the federal government and T.O. Community College. The T.O. Nation shares approx 66 miles with the US/Mexico border.

"We are the conscientious citizens who find that that the actions of the legislature are more extreme than the wishes of us or most of our neighbors.nIncreasingly, the United States has suffered from political polarization to the extremes with elected representatives on both sides being unrepresentative of those of their constituents especially in local elections. In many cases, the root of this the lack of competitive districting in which case elections are frequently resolved in the primary. This has resulted in legislators who spend their time and that of the body crafting narrow legislation to appeal to the primary base and not to benefit the citizens at large. A critical way to address this is to ensure that districts are drawn to be as competitive as possible, squashing this tendency to legislate on the behalf of a very narrow slice of the population.  "

"My community, located south of Sunrise, is tied together by its active, retired professionals to include military families like myself.  Many of my neighbors and I have lived and worked abroad. Some were born in different parts of the world to include Mexico, Canada and Asia.  I'm Caucasian and greatly enjoy this neighborhood because of my love for diversity. We are a close community which is bonded by staying active in sports, working to improving our community, and helping one another in times of need.

Throughout our time together, my neighbors and I keep each other informed of changes, necessary to keep up w all we do. We play pickle ball, hike throughout the Catalinas, participate in the arts downtown, and volunteer for TUSD & SNAP. We volunteer in Sabino Canyon, remove its buffelgrass and repair its trails. Often we carpool to outdoor concerts at Udall Park on Tanque Verde.  Widows carpool to downtown Tucson for theater and art shows. Weekly, we join to eat at local restaurants. nMy husband & I moved to Tucson in 2005, for our last assignment of his 30-yr Air Force career. Moving from Germany, we fell in love with the diverse cultures, cycling, hiking & art opportunities all available within this small city. Huge basketball fans, we attended UA basketball games and downtown theaters, and loved the large selection of international restaurants throughout the city. My husband continued racing his road bike here, on Mt Lemmon. I rode my first century in El Tour de Tucson. We felt ""at home"" here, so retired in 2007, worked for Raytheon, and bought in Fairfield Subdivision, East of Craycroft/South of Sunrise, LD9.

I'm most appreciative for my neighbors now, more than ever. Many of us are widowed. I lost my husband to the Mountain he loved racing down.  During that very difficult time, my neighbors sustained me. Just as we military spouses leaned on each other when military deployments began in August 1990, so do my LD9 neighbors and I.

"My name is Linda Evans, Catalina Foothills, area code 85718. My testimony was given on Saturday, Aug. 7, at La Paloma, Pima County.

My stated argument and map was posted on this Community Survey: 
Per Chair Erica Newman’s request, stated during the IRC Commission Meeting, Tuesday, August 10:
ISSUE: Lack of “Competitiveness” (solid history of Republicans since 2012, not getting representation, not getting elected.)

"The northwest side of Tucson contains several parks that are well used by the community, and provide a respite for residents and a variety of fauna, flora, and opportunities for bird watching and bike riding.

Sun Transit connects these communities, and could be expanded. The roads in this community need attention.n"
"A diverse population of people both in wealth and cultural background. Incorporates the iconic Sonoran Desert and Sky Islands. Rich in indigenous peoples knowledge, history as well as the challenges they still face in the genocide and lack of access to resources they've faced since American colonization. Two big employers in the area are the Univ. of AZ and Raytheon - both of which bring a lot of education and highly educated people to the area. Housing has become a big security issue, particularly for renters as the rent has risen precipitously in the last 5 years. Access to clean water is also an issue which Tucson has handled very innovatively but a more widespread approach is still needed as water access still below what's sustainably replenished. Tucson faces voter suppression in many forms from statewide measures as well in the form of limiting access to the number of voting booths as well as limitations to things like ballot collecting.n"
"I am a Nogalian and the I-19 corridor north to Tucson, Pasqua and San Javier Tohono Nations have been our livelihood.  I consider Nogales to be an extension of Tucson, and Tucson an extension of Nogales.  We travel up and down the I-19 corridor in a multiple and variety of ways.  We go shopping toTucson, we fly out of Tucson, we enjoy the entertainment and dinning in Tucson, we support the University of Arizona and its sports traditions.

Tucson and Nogales are an extension of each other.  We speak the same language, we have the same traditions.  Our grandparents were tribal and we honor the and participate in the tribal ceremonies with the Pasqua and Tohono Nation.

The business infrastructure and agriculture industry of Nogales heads north through the I-19 corridor and Patagonia.

Our families live in and work in Rio Rico, Tubac, Green Valley, Sahuarita, and Tucson.

It is natural to honor the districting north from Nogales to Tucson.  This corridor is is our livelihoodnKeep Nogales in the I-19 corridor north to Tucson."
"Our community of interest is Goldfield Ranch, a rural neighborhood located in the Tonto National Forest, part of Maricopa County. A largely equine community, we have community events and social groups within our neighborhood. Our houses are typically on multi-acre lots, but the vast majority of our neighbors (myself included) commute regularly into the Phoenix metropolitan area (particularly Fountain Hills, but also Scottsdale) for work, shopping, and other activities. As a purely residential community, we don't have any businesses within Goldfield Ranch, so our connection with the Fountain Hills town is very important. For instance, all grocery shopping happens in Fountain Hills. Many of my neighbors worship in churches in Fountain Hills or Scottsdale. Social activities outside of Goldfield Ranch specifically tend to be in Fountain Hills. It is for this reason that I believe Goldfield Ranch and Fountains Hills constitute a single community of interest.nI believe firmly in the constitutional provisions of one-person, one-vote. When some districts vary wildly in terms of population, it dilutes the votes of some - meaning some people's votes count more in terms of legislation that impact us all equally. I hope that the IRC creates districts that have equal population. I believe that competitiveness, while also a constitutional criterion, should not be used to excuse unequal districts - as the Constitution states ""where to do so would create no significant detriment to the other goals.""

Furthermore, I believe we should be in a district that is connected with Fountain Hills, and if possible, the greater Scottsdale area. Currently, our community is in CD4, which doesn't necessarily represent the character or nature of where we live and work."
"This map is intended to include the entire Tohono O'Odham Nation, including San Xavier.  This area should be kept in a Pima County LD and CD.   All connections are to Pima County, not Yuma County.  The Nation includes two casinos in the southern end of Pima Country which largely serve Pima County.   Shopping and other activities tend to be within Pima County and in the Tucson Metro Area.   nThe Nation is currently in LD 4 which is largely in Yuma county and goes to Maricopa County to the north.   Please keep the Nation connected to the Tucson Metro area."
"I'm from Lakeside in Navajo County, I believe that all of Navajo County is a community of interest that belongs in a majority Native American district.  My children attend school in Lakeside, where their classmates include many Indigenous children, from White Mountain Apache (WMAT) and other tribes, the local economy is dependent on WMAT and our community thrives on partnerships between the Tribe and our town.  

 This is true of all of  the border towns in Navajo County, Show Low, Pinetop/Lakeside, Winslow and Holbrook,  these towns account  for  the vast majority of the county's population.  Further having the county seat of Holbrook in the same  legislative district is important for ensuring the county's needs are lobbied for in the State Legislature.

 nIt is important to have a district that has a Native American majority to ensure that the voices of those who are protected by the Voting Rights Act are heard.  Therefore a district that includes all of Navajo, and  Apache Counties the small portions of Gila that include White Mountain and San Carlos Apache Nation as well as the the current sovereign lands in LD7 is important to comply with federal law.  

We know that people and not land vote and we must have a large district, it by including all of Navajo and Apache Counties you meet the requirement of having contiguous and regularly shaped districts."
"This is an affluent area of Tempe. It tends to be conservative and probably more independent than one party or the other. Primarily English speaking and primarily Anglo but seeing an increase in black and Asian residents. Typically well educated and would probably be classified as “Responsible” as it is heavily “Boomers.”

ASU is part of this community to the north but not necessarily a consideration in the map outline I provided as ASU is over 5 miles away.

The populace can be mobilized as evidenced by a community effort to save a failing Basha store and heavy involvement to not allow the cardinals stadium to be built at I-10 and Warner.nMy particular interest would be District 9 from roughly Pecos on the South to Lincoln on the north. That is a ridiculous example of districting  because  that district crosses so many communities, and encompasses so much commercial space, It is possible for a candidate to heavily saturate one segment of the district and win election. That causes all other segments to become disenfranchised. 

My motivation is to see districting that requires any party to have to become involved and represent all parties actually living in the district as much as possible. 

I also believe that a party that feels they have to rely on selective districting does not actually have a viable message or mission."
"This map is an attempt to show areas in Pima County inhabited largely by Hispanics.  Parts of this area are densely populated.   This community includes The City of South Tucson south to areas north of San Xavier.   This community should be fairly represented in the legislature by being shared by two minority-majority LDs.   nLD 3 is currently overly Democratic.   Over half of the population are registered as Democrats.  About 1/3 are No Party, but traditionally vote Democratic.   LD 3 has only one precinct that frequently votes Republican.   While keeping a minority-majority status, its Democrats and Democratic-learning No Party voters should be better distributed to neighboring districts, most notably the area to the north in the Tucson Mountains, which could be better shared with what is now LD 11 and overly Republican.   
LD 2 which includes Santa Cruz County currently is closer to being competitive, sharing most of the Green Valley area as it does.   Tucson's south side should be connected to Santa Cruz County as it is now, sharing Hispanic identity.   
Minority-majority and competitiveness should both be considered in drawing new districts."
"My community is rural Picture Rocks, which includes Saguaro National Park, the Desert Museum, mountains to hike and the like-minded individuals who live here.  We are all here for the natural environment and the peaceful, low population area.  I share with my neighbors the natural desert and the desire for the lack of commercial development.  We have a handful of stores and that's it.  It's important to me to be able to vote with my neighbors for our representatives and on our issues of concern.  This area is special, it's why we live here and why we share these bonds of community and nature.n"

Our Counties are already diverse in cultural and political make-up so please apply the redistricting criteria maintaining our homogeneity. Thank you."
"My mother is from Window Rock, father is from Kayenta, maternal grandmother is from Lupton & paternal grandmother is from Dilkon. I grew up in all these communities & still reside &  work in both Apache & Navajo counties. My work takes me all over northeast AZ counties. Our current districts (LD 6 & 7) are our whole community of interest. Even the whole state with 22 federally recognized tribes is a community of interest. We are mobile; work, attend school, & access public services in these areas. Our CD-01 is the most Native American district in the whole country. This is significant, because nowhere else in the U.S. do we have this kind of population. We must keep this intact. The commission has to recognize tribal nations, and those tribal citizens that work and live off tribal lands and in border towns like St. John, Sanders, Flagstaff, Page, Holbrook, Winslow, Show Low, Pinetop-Lakeside, & others. This is critical. Keeping Native voting power and representation whole. Thank you.nThe IRC must have improved communication with the public. I planned on attending the Kayenta satellite mtg on July 31when I saw it on the IRC website then told family & friends to attend. Show Low is over 3hrs away & Hopi’s location was listed in Kymotskovi. Then without notice, & only a few days prior to the scheduled Navajo Co. IRC public mtg, both Kayenta & Hopi locations were removed from the website, leaving only one location available for Navajo Co. residents. This leaves out a large voting population & communities of interests.  

Public communication and general education is critical and needs to be timely. Translation should also be done and available in multiple languages like Navajo, Hopi, and Apache. There has to be an offline and online communication/pr strategy to reach community people that don’t have access to the internet, a computer, or can’t just scan codes or submit online. This is especially true for a large elder voting population and rural and tribal communities."
"The Catalina Foothills includes doctors, nurses, lawyers, engineers, teachers, retirees and stay at home parents. We enjoy being a suburb of the city of Tucson but not in the city. We enjoy more open space between homes and designated wildlife areas and spacious drainages. Please don't include us in the city of Tucson. There's a reason why we have refused to be incorporated or annexed over the years. We have more in common with the TV Valley and Marana, etc. than we do with the people on the City Council. I don’t feel like the city council represents our area’s values. n"
"Our community is a part of Pima county our demographics are well documented. We are a community of well educated residents who tend to be professionals working at Raytheon, Davis-Monthan, and Law Enforcement to include border patrol. nWe have little in common with those who live south of Sahuarita. In redistricting our community, we should not be artificially grouped with areas outside our county with whom we share little in common. "
"We live off of Hacienda del Sol (Camino Antonio), visit multiple times a week with (and rely for childcare on) our parents who also live off of Hacienda del Sol (in Cat 10) and Camino Real, respectively.  Our other relatives live nearby.  Our children attend Sunrise Drive Elementary School.  I work downtown at 400 W. Congress, where I spend 4 days a week and therefore frequent establishments for food, shopping, and other needs and services (yoga, haircuts, etc.).  I serve on the board of 2 nonprofits, both of which are located on Speedway between Campbell Avenue and the Freeway (Casa de los Ninos and Catholic Community Services).  My husband works at TMC mostly, also surgery centers on River Road/Hacienda del Sol and on Alvernon. He swims at the Tucson Racquet Club and runs on the River Walk.  We almost never go north of Sunrise Drive or West of Campbell Ave.  We periodically visit friends in Tucson proper, the East side of town, or drive east to travel to a cabin on Mt. Lemmon.n"
"The cities of Tempe, Chandler, and Gilbert are tied together by education, high-tech employment, and diversity. Tempe is home to Arizona State University, and residents of the region benefit from proximity to a great university, including classes, cultural resources, and senior involvement through Scholar OLLI. Chandler and Gilbert have some of the best schools in Arizona. Chandler, in particular, is the location of high-tech employment, with Intel having multiple campuses and thousands of employees. Other tech companies include NXP Semiconductors, Northrop Grumman, Avnet, and others. Employees of these companies live in all three cities and enrich their communities. Because of both ASU and the tech companies, these three cities are more diverse than suburban towns usually are, with employees coming from all over the world. Children grow up used to making friends in a diverse, multicultural social group, which prepares them well for their adult lives.nIt is a pleasure to live in Chandler; I have also lived in Gilbert. These cities are very family-oriented and are safe, enriching areas to grow up in. There are many opportunities for children and families in the three cities. Thank you for the opportunity to participate, and I will be interested in seeing the process of redistricting as it unfolds."
"This is mostly populated by Caucasian retirees, many of whom only live here during the winter.  Availability of medical services is a big issue.nThe Green Valley/Quail Creek area where I live is primarily populated with retired white conservatives from out of state who fear the shifting racial and political demographics taking place in this state and country.  As a group it has become apparent that frightened conservatives will do everything possible to establish single party rule -- Republican, of course -- primarily through gerrymandering and voter suppression.  

This effort includes bombarding the IRC with lie-filled propaganda falsely describing the previous redistricting as being grossly unfair and unequal.  No doubt the IRC sees through this childish smear campaign.  

Arizona has become a “purple” state and should stay that way through continued fair and equal redistricting that protects and enhances the political power of Arizona’s growing communities of color.  This will result in competitive political contests and higher quality representation for all.

Thank you for your hard work!

"I've lived, gone to school and worked in various parts of Tucson since 1978. My community of interest is Southern Arizona – especially the people, landscape and biota of Southeast Arizona. My community is centered in Tucson, which is in the Sky Island region – a landscape of desert and grassland punctuated by sky islands of towering mountains. The place I hold dear includes the Santa Cruz River Valley and stretches from the Tucson, Silverbell, Santa Catalinas, Rincon, Galiuro, Pinaleno, Chiricahua and Huachucha mountain ranges. I value the region's rich multicultural heritage, including our Mexican heritage, the Native American tribes, and even more ancient residents – and also our residents from other regions of the world. I also value our ranching, agricultural and railroad roots. Tucson's vibrant community stems from the mix – which is reflected in our being named a UNESCO City of Gastronomy in 2016 and our thriving arts community encompassing theatre, visual arts, music and more.nPlease make sure that the redistricting maps provide competitive districts."
"Our community in Tucson has a number of common interests in immigration, employment, governance, climate and water policy, and land use. nOur current representation districts encompass large areas outside our community that dilute our representative's interests in our local representation and must be simplified."
"Ahwatukee, South Tempe, South Mesa and West Chandler are diverse, interconnected and self contained communities with good public schools, employment, shopping and open space.  n"
This is the Tanque Verde and Vail Valleys.  This is the East corridor along the National Park and to the Freeway.  It is a more rural area and separate from the Tucson Urban center.  The Vail Valley is a combination of older Suburban Ranch properties and newly constructed subdivision but the people by in large see them selves as separate from Tucson Urban and there is a monolithic culture.nThis should all be one district.
"I envision a community that is linked by a common need for affordable housing, SUSTAINABLE tourism, and disaster prevention/recovery efforts.  nI am not as familiar with fire districts as I should be.  Keeping the fire districts and the counties where they overlap in communication and working toward updating safety for residents and tourists is paramount.  "
"The Verde Valley should be united, including Cottonwood, Jerome, Sedona, Camp Verde, Rimrock, Cornville, the village of Oak Creek and all the communities contained therein.  All these communities have natural, social and political ties to each other such as healthcare, shopping, eco-tourism, climate issues and are developing regional ties to each other through transportation, education, and co-mingling of resources.  The Verde Valley community looks towards Flagstaff for health, education and the direction of further development, such as Climate Action Plans.  Indeed, our water depends on the mountains of Flagstaff, whereas, the Prescott watershed helps Phoenix.  We are divided not only by a mountain, but Prescott has always put the concerns of the Verde Valley on it's back burner
We are in desperate need of unification!n**My map is a rough draft, as I found the mapping skill not to be me-friendly."
"LD 18 is a diverse community bounded generally by Southern Avenue on the north, Dobson/Alma School Road on the east, Pecos Road on the south and the South Mountain Preserve on the west.  Residents of LD 18 have divergent perspectives but in general support and respect the humanity of all residents.  The varying opinions and perspectives of its residents helps to ensure that issues are viewed based on their merits.  I strongly encourage the Redistricting Commission to retain the current boundaries for LD 18.n"
"Central Tucson is basically a college town. It is not our community.
Our community is the Tanque Verde Valley with its wide open spaces, large lots, and neighbors who respect each other’s privacy.  We found shared values on both sides of the aisle. We are truly a community that looks nothing like the city of Tucson.  And we want as little to do with Tucson as possible.  Unless it’s North along Sunrise, we rarely venture West of Kolb. We shop, we eat, we socialize on the East side of Pima County.  
The TVV has a very rural feel to it.  It is horse country, even in some of the areas annexed by the city.   The Ace Hardware on Bear Canyon – a mile from our home – has everything you need to raise your own chickens in your back yard. 
We got to know our state legislators and they got to know us. They had regular townhalls and kept us informed about the goings-on in Phoenix.  The old LD 30 was truly a community of interest.nAll this changed in 2011, when a corrupt redistricting commission targeted our district and destroyed our community of interest be extending our western boundary into downtown Tucson and neighborhoods surrounding the University – the same areas we rejected in our initial home search.  These people did not share our interests, and in the ensuing 10 years the east side of Pima county has had no representation.  We never see them on the east side. I can’t recall ever having a Townhall. Our Democrat legislators don’t need our votes, and they know it.  LD 10 is not a competitive district, and not a community of interest.  
There is a pretty clear delineation between the central city and the outlying communities on the North, East, and South.  Think of a backward “C” that runs from Saddlebrook, around the mountains North of the river, then down into the Tanque Verde valley.  Continue South along the Houghton Corridor, then West to Quail Creek."
"We currently live in Precinct 178...North of Tanque Verde...East of Bear Canyon spanning to Houghton Road...Our area is more rural with approx. 1 acre lots...Horse property is allowed too.We live in Pima County, not the City of Tucson...Our area of interest spans the Houghton Corridor...

When we first moved here, we lived in Legislative District 30 in 2002…We had consistent representation for many years.  LD 30 included the east side where we have more conservative values…We are protected by the Rincon District Office and we want them supported and respected…In fact, we had an irregularity with our security system…The Sheriff’s Department showed up out of concern before the actual alarm went off that we could hear…Plus, we were not charged for a false alarm like they do in the City of Tucson…Most people on the Eastside of Pima County share the same values…nSadly, the City of Tucson wants to defund their Police Department and there is a constant struggle for funding and support…Many residents in the City of Tucson suffer the consequences of those policies…

After the 2010 redistricting, LD 30 was targeted to be redrawn to include midtown Tucson 
which is contrary to our conservative values…Thus, our Tanque Verde Valley has lacked 
representation that we wanted for 10 years…Many people have become disenfranchised and discouraged by the total lack of representation.  Many of us feel invisible…

LD10 is not competitive or representative of our values…As of Monday August 2, 2021, the percentage of party representation is biased to DEM (40%) as opposed to REP (29.5%) Other (30.5%).   We need a stronger voice in Phoenix."
"We are a Mexican American working class community. We are bicultural and bilingual. We are located on the border at a major port of entry. nWe have a right to elect representatives that we can hold accountable. As a latino, Mexican American community it is in our best interest to elect leaders that we can relate to so that we can move forward the urgenicies that our communty needs as well as hold accountable those leaders. At minimum the commision must maintain the same number of districts that we have now. We are well served by our two representatives that closely monitor our region. We must be able to continue to vote for people that are from our communities. Thank you. "
"12 years ago I immigrated to Arizona with my family. We could have chosen anywhere but we chose Chandler because, despite it being part of a sprawling metropolis, the city of Chandler felt like it had a distinct identity - it welcomes immigrants, hosts vibrant, multicultural community events, and also benefits from the excellence of Chandler Unified schools. My children have thrived, we've made many friends, and we decided to stay and become citizens. As an immigrant and now an American, it has been confusing that CUSD's boundaries don't align with Chandler City Council or local Legislative districts. I hope that redistricting can make these more unified whilst keeping Chandler as a whole because this was the city above any other in AZ that I chose to be my home. Please don't damage Chandler's unique character by carving it up. I hope all Chandler Unified schools could also be kept together to provide continuity for our children and because they are important centers for the community.nThe only downside to Chandler and need for me to include a larger area on my map, is it's lack of a Non-Discrimination Ordinance and lack of opportunities for it's LGBTQ+ community members to meet up. We remain hidden because we have to travel outside Chandler, to Central Phoenix, Tempe, Mesa and Scottsdale, to meet up or find LGBTQ+ friendly services. We also remain hidden in the Census. I find it interesting that the places I've felt safe and found LGBTQ+ services and other members of my community, not only all have Non-Discrimination Ordinances but also roughly align with the current Arizona 9th Congressional District . I respectfully ask that outreach and public comments be sought once the grid maps are released (and translated where needed) to members of more hidden communities including those who are LGBTQ+, disabled, Asian, Native American, black, Latinx etc."
"I live in the northwest part of Pima County in southern Oro Valley.  I believe I have more in common with communities in Pima County than being in a Legislative District like LD 11 which includes parts of Pinal County and Northwestern Pima County.  I live in an area which is full of retirees, not an agricultural area. I believe that towns like Oro Valley, Marana and Catalina  have more in common with the city of Tucson than Casa Grande or Eloy.  Our water needs  are very different from the agricultural needs of Pinal County.  I attend Church in the Catalina Foothills, shop in Tucson, eat out in Tucson and attend programs at the U of A.  My community of interest is much focused on Pima County and Tucson and I would like my state legislative district to reflect that reality.nI live in CD 1.  I attended one of your listening sessions in Pima County and heard many complaints about the size of  CD 1 and arguments that people in Southern Arizona having nothing in common with people in Northern Arizona especially Navajos.   But a federal congressional district is much larger than a state legislative district.  What I expect from the Commission with respect to Congressional Districts is that each district reflect  the diverse communities in our state and that the districts be competitive.  Competitive districts are not safe red or blue districts.  Safe districts result in extreme polarization which is plaguing our state and our nation.  So I don't care about the size of my Congressional District in terms of geography.  I want it to represent a fair cross section of Arizona's citizens including communities of color and native Americans."
"I live in unincorporated Pima County.  I feel Congressional and Legislative Districts need geographical boundaries with common lifestyle issues and to allow the elected Representative manageable travel distances.
My Community of interest is drawn with physical road boundaries, that encompasses suburban and rural areas.  This community shares interests in business, worship, education, healthcare, recreation, public safety, and law enforcement.  The population is varied with many types of households, ethnicities, and economic resources.  This area has grown the past ten years.
I share all the above interests with a focus on rural and recreational lifestyle. This community should be included with other areas with rural aspect and should be kept separate from urban Tucson City.
The task before you is to evaluate and draw boundaries that meet your five criteria, that are balanced, and that allow representation for our community interests.
Thank you.n"
"The current Catalina Foothills, along with the area between river and the university, from Park on the West over to Craycroft on the right. nI prefer the current LD9 designation."
"In the community that I live (Safford/Thatcher/Pima/Solomon), there is about half white and half Hispanic along with other people of color. The white portion are mostly Mormons, and they have all the political and community power. People here work in the mines, farming, the prisons, Walmart and many other low wage jobs. Most are on the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum. The dominant political ideology is conservative, but there are more liberals than you might expect. They are afraid to be identified as liberal or as a Democrat because of the stigma and they don’t want to be alienated or have doors closed on them within their jobs. Few who move in from outside of the community stay. We are divided here. It would be nice to be able to feel free to speak openly and be authentic. It would be nice to have the leadership represent the actual diversity that exists here. It would be nice to have a voice.
nMy community is segregated. There is the dominant group who are white Mormons. Then there's everyone else: Hispanics, other people of color, and nonMormon white people. The dominant group holds all the power and are the gatekeepers to leadership, jobs and business. People of color especially have difficulty rising up within the current system. 

I live in a white/Mormon neighborhood. There are meetings about how to keep the people from the neighborhood behind us out (mostly Hispanic). There is now a tall fence that keeps them out which also keeps out children who need to walk through for a direct route to school.  

Even schools are segregated. White Mormons largely send their kids to certain schools. Teachers from outside don’t stay. People from outside who want to settle here feel isolated and unwelcome, and then they leave. 

There should be ways for people of color to advance in leadership. We should value new people, not repel them. Here, only one group matters.
"
"I live in the Hadley Precinct, in the City of Avondale home of NASCAR, Latinx/Hispanic Majority district with large African-America, Black, Caribbean and more AAPI living happy with our White community members. We need education, high tech and high paying industries and ease access to our political leaders. It is ideal to map an LD that includes all the public schools that our children can attend in our cities limits. There are numerous school districts that serve the families of the City of Avondale:
▲	West-MEC - Western Maricopa Education Center
▲	Litchfield Elementary District 
▲	Pendergast Elementary District 
▲	Avondale Elementary District 
▲	Littleton Elementary District
▲	Tolleson Union High School District 
We are native Arizonans, immigrants, or moved from other parts of the country to the valley; it's melting pot that's growing. From Billy Moore Days, to Goodyear Lakeside Music Festival, West Valley Cultural Festival, we love family, faith, fitness, food, fun and fellowship. nThere are tons of service sector, union manufacturing and transportation related jobs in our community. Many of our residents are highly skilled and may work remote in various industries. Some of the residents live and work in our community. Most commute to areas in Avondale, Buckeye, El Mirage, City of Glendale, Goodyear, Litchfield Park, Laveen, Maryvale, New River, Peoria, Surprise, Tolleson, Tempe, Tucson & Phoenix to work in technology, financial services, and in the college community. We have infrastructure needs to move the traffic swiftly through the I-10 corridor to the Loops 101, 202, 303 & SR 85, 60 without traffic congestion and increased pollution. We need environmental justice and civil rights to protect the sacred lands, air, and water. We have the beautiful Tres Rios Recreational area where the Salt, Gila and Aqua Fria Rivers connect at the foothills of the Estrella Mountain Regional Park. We have robust city services from school districts and  Maricopa County."
"I work downtown, my husband works at TMC, and I take my kids to daycare and parks in the city. I do most of my shopping in midtown, and bank in midtown. I meet friends and dine in midtown and downtown. I’m a member of the board of the Tucson girls chorus, which pulls girls from all over the city to Mehl Park, but has a separate location on the northwest side.n"
"We are a community of mainly retired, employed commuters, families and school-aged children.  We have little agriculture and manufacturing.  Most are small businesses and retail stores.  We are more urban than rural. nWe should should not be grouped in voting districts with mining and agriculture.  We should be affiliated with Tucson and not Pinal Co.  We should not be in CD1  but rather in a Tucson or Pima county Cong. District."
"The SW Arizona, USA boarder region is currently a part of CD 3 and it makes sense that a portion of Maricopa County's SW valley as well as some of Pima, Pinal, Yuma and La Paz counties; however, the needs of SE Arizona differ from that of the SW part of the state. So it may be best to allow the city of Tucson to be joined in a CD with parts of Pima, Pinal and Santa Cruz Counties.nThis area would redraw the lines of the existing CD 3; we should still be included in a Mexico/USA boarder region."
"This neighborhood is a unique community south of the 60 and east of the 101 that is involved in their local schools, churches, and community organizations around Dobson Ranch. It is much more similar culturally to the neighbors east and south of the area than north and east.n"
These groups live in subdivisions in North Phoenix.  They have similar size lots and live in like subdivisions.nPLease make sure the IRC reviews ALL comments.
"My community of interest is Casa Adobes, Marana and Oro Valley.  This area is an urban area with private residences, multi-family dwellings, businesses, medical service providers, and schools.   My neighbors and I are closely involved with the City of Tucson for employment, personal services, University of Arizona activities,  shopping, museums, art, book stores, and entertainment.  When redistricting LD 11, please let us be represented as an urban area.n"
"Oro Valley, Marana, Saddlebrooken"
"Senior population, public safety, low crime, preserving the scenic beauty & environment, growth management, design standards, high quality schools, parks & nature trails.  

Saddlebrooke & Saddlebrooke Ranch residents come to Oro Valley to shop, dine & obtain medical care at the OV hospital. Marana, Catalina & Eaglecrest residents do the same.  
We attend the same churches; our kids & grandkids attend the same schools & play sports together; we hike in Honeybee Canyon & Catalina State Park; we shop at OV Marketplace & the Saturday farmers market. 
nOur interests are clearly NOT aligned with cities such as Tucson or Flagstaff.  We should not be included with an part of the City of Tucson.
CD1 is too large & does not offer fair representation to those who choose to live in the suburbs rather than crowded cities with limited public safety & bad roads."
"My name is Sarah Ramsey.  I am a Precinct Committeeman in Precinct 239 in semi rural Legislative District 9.  Most of my neighbors are retired, work from home, have part time jobs or volunteer for organizations like Toronto Chul, Pima County Animal Shelter, or Gap Ministries.  Most everyone I know is active - hiking, birding, golfing, tennis, gardening and involved in Civic Organizations in the parks and open spaces in the areas surrounding the Catalina Mountains.  Food, home repair products, health products, personal services, clothing are all handled north of River Road or off Tanque Verde Rd.  Restaurants too.  We support local small businesses entrepreneurs.  I moved here specifically for single family ownership and open spaces - 73% of the housing is single family and owned by the resident.  My family and friends here care about public safety, keeping our taxes low, taking care of our homes and neighborhoods, water management, appreciating and conserving the Sonoran Desert.nThe current Legislative and Congressional Districts do not represent the interests or values  of most of the people I know who live near me.  As a result of being lumped in with an urban area with very different priorities ( higher water rates for unincorporated Pima County, $15 minimum wage, high rise housing, for example) I feel disenfranchised because I have NO representation at the Pima County Board of Supervisor level, the Arizona Legislature,  or the US Congress.  If the boundaries do not change, I do not see things changing.  To influence the City of Tucson, a citizen needs to be able to vote for the mayor and other elected leadership.  Here in the Catalina Foothills we cannot even vote.  We have much more in common with semi rural, suburban Oro Valley and Marana.   In addition, there are natural boundaries like the Rillito, Tanque Verde, and Santa Cruz Rivers and the Catalina Mountains which make much more sense from a land management standpoint."
"We are a mainly rural area but we do have necessary services for living, shopping and worshipping. Transit is insufficient for those without cars. Much of the land is open range and some of the lovliest southern AZ scenery is a car ride away.
Areas of concern: mining and agricultural interests threaten our water supply, climate change, and the lives of the people living here. While we are near an urban area, we need different representation for our rural concerns. LD2 is RURAL and needs to remain so!n"
"Very rural, plenty of ranching, many retired persons, protective of our water rights, large military and ex-military population, deeply affected by porous international border. nI don't think we share much ""community"" with Tucson, nor with Nogales, but we are well connected with the area west of the Huachuca Mountains. Above all, we want to be known as part of Arizona, not a forgettable suburb of Maricopa and Pima counties, and not ceded to the Republic of Mexico. "
"Black Arizonans are a diverse, vibrant, & resilient group of people within this state that includes Black people who have lived here for many generations, as well as recent immigrants. Black Arizonans include African American descendants of many nations & tribes forced into slavery since before this country’s founding, descendants from the African diaspora in the Americans, & recent African migrants & refugees. Black Arizonans reside in every community throughout this state. We are also LGBTQ+, cis & trans, Disabled, religious & non-religious, working class & low-income, unhoused, formerly & currently incarcerated, drug users, & sex workers, inhabiting all walks of life, experiences, & intersecting identities & cultures. Black Arizonans reside in most communities throughout the state, from the biggest cities to the smallest towns. In some areas we’re concentrated in certain neighborhoods due to the legacy of segregation, in others, we’re spread out & marooned from one another.nThere’s no AZ without Black history & culture, throughout its entire history up to now. However, our vibrant history here has been deliberately eroded & our political power has been purposefully diluted. In every AZ community Black people are subjected to micro & macro-aggressive racism, institutionalized White Supremacy, environmental injustice, anti-Black government decision-making that systemically harms us. During another urgent era where Black people’s rights are being suppressed through voter restriction laws in a resurgence of Jim Crow policymaking, our voices must not be erased in the redistricting process & the district boundaries produced. Even though we are a minority in this state, we have never deserved marginalization. Black people must be rightfully & structurally empowered to determine our own political futures & select representation that originates from & serves our communities. This determines the quality & liberty of our lives & the destinies of our children."
"I work at a local convenience gas station store. My community is unique. It is largely Hispanic, but it is also very diverse. I get to speak to so many local & non-locals. The non-local come from Mexico, & others from the North heading to Mexico. Some are here for work, law enforcement, medical professionals, teachers.  Others are here on business, others passing thru.  For some, Nogales is their tourist destination. I credit that my community is right on the border & I credit the I19 corridor; both are crucial to our local economy. We are unique & require representation that can keep healthy & open relationships with our closest neighbors, Mexico & Tucson.nWe need representation that understands that our tourism is not just about Mexico, but also people point out they are visiting the Patagonia/ Sky island region. They point out they are here to visit Rio Rico, Tubac & yes, Nogales as well. We need representation that is mindful of the environment, the diversity that exists here. In my opinion, it’s not a good idea to split Santa Cruz County by district lines. Thank you for your attention and service."
"This area shares a common geography, time of development, shopping locations, schools, supermarkets, frequent places of worship, use the same parks, ride the same buses and often use the same thorough fares to move about Tucson.n"
"Residents of the Catalina Foothills are an extension of the City of Tucson and have much more in common with Tucson than with any other nearby area.  I can't figure out how to add points to the map, but the northern boundary of the Foothills runs from around Oracle/Ina to Sabino Canyon/Sunrise, and the southern boundary is River Road. n"
"Retired and working people (at the mine, for the county or Morenci or Duncan Schools), largely Hispanic who speak English.n"
"There are several issues which tie my community of interest together.  The area I drew on the map contains rural areas with focus on horses and the American Western lifestyle.  My Community Boundary may contain a very wide range of income and wealth but, more importantly, it shares cultural values, language, religious values and recreational interests.  In the developed areas within the Community Boundary I shop, do business, eat out, use medical facilities and meet friends for recreational activities.  I go months without traveling south of the Rillito River (River Road).nLiving in Picture Rocks I have a Tucson address.  However the  City of Tucson is about as far as you can get from Picture Rocks in all of the areas you use to define a Community of Interest.

"The Az State Constitution says:
District boundaries shall respect communities of interest

My community of interest is north of River Rd. The Catalina Foothills community. We have a quarterly news magazine devoted to our community. My kids attend Pusch Ridge Christian. I attend Catalina Foothills Church. We shop, eat and socialize north of river. Our healthcare visits, jobs, and friends are all north of River Rd. We recreate, swim and hike at Sabino Canyon protected wildlife preserve. Our community is mostly retired and young professional families. We have unique environmental concerns, such as preserving wildlife corridors through our neighborhoods, horse rescues, stables and boarding. We have hiking, wildlife clubs, and art museums etc. We have purposefully chosen to move away from the city of Tucson. We don’t want to be governed by the city of Tucson. Nor should the city to be governed by us. We are set apart by county lines and we deserve to have like minded representation. 
nIt is a violation of the intent of the Voting Rights Acts to dilute the votes of like minded minority communities & their interests. Why not keep midtown together? Retirement communities together? Rural communities together? 
Currently the 2nd largest region in Arizona has no representation.
2. Our State Constitution says district lines shall use visible geographic features, city, town and county boundaries
1) To have a northern corridor that stretches from green valley & Saddlebrook to Tanque verde Valley and out to Houghton East. These communities share a unique rural environment away from the city, focusing on families, ranching, retirement communities
2) A midtown corridor that encompasses the city, Downtown area, U of A, the theatre district = the overall city lifestyle. 
3) A southern corridor of Vail, Rita Ranch, the military base, Raytheon 
These 3 corridors make sense, while giving representation to like minded communities w/o diluting the votes of any people groups."
"My community is based on the belief Congressional and state legislative district boundaries should allow for free, fair, competitive, and open elections. Gerrymandering boundaries for political advantage should never be allowed.nCongressional and state legislative district boundaries should be based on existing County and/or City boundaries as far as practical, or geographical features such as rivers, mountains, or highways to comply with equally populated requirements. District outlines should be as straight as possible to have contiguous and compact boundaries in order to prevent Gerrymandering to create district boundaries with political advantage for political parties or legislators. This will prevent dilution of voting power of specific regions or neighborhoods, who have common political, social, or economic interests."
"Asian American, Pacific Islander, Native Hawaiian- Chinese, Filipino (Tagalog) , Korean, Indian (Tamil), Japanese, Marshallese, Chukees, Samoan, Cambodian (Khmer) Vietnamese, Buddhist, Christian, business owners, tech workers, educators, community health care workers, celebrate lunar new year, English as a second language learner, Asian District in Mesa to frequent Asian grocery stores and restaurants.nMore outreach in language provided in regards to redistricting process for the AZ AANHPI community. There's hardly any communities of color attending and participating in the public hearing. Reach out to ethnic media and community organizations to support with the outreach efforts. The AZ AANHPI community is the fastest growing population and our input is important.

Thank you."
"Historically this area has always been intertwined through cultural ties, economic interests and common goals. Billions of dollars annually in foreign trade from the Mexican produce industry, significant tourist activity and product shipping from the Twin Plant facilities on the Mexican side of the border are facilitated through this area.  It is only reasonable to believe that the residents in this area should most certainly be congressionally represented by the same individuals so as to further facilitate the economy and education of the areas residents.nI strongly believe that this area should be kept in the same congressional district."
"Rural Conservative community made up of Miners FMI, farming, ranching, government workers, retirees, generations of families. religious affiliations mainly Mormon and Catholic, small businesses, college and public schools. nPlease keep the rural community rural, please do not connect us with Tucson. As it is, we are connected to Sierra Vista so people who are elected mainly come from there, so we, in this small county do not have a voice. Keep the mining communities together, the copper corridor. Have competitive districts within 4% of either party."
"My immediate community of interest is the central Phoenix area.  Our community is diverse:  According to the most recent information available, we are a minority-majority area in that non-Hispanic whites make up less than 50% of the population. The Commission should ensure that the voting power of our communities of color is protected and enhanced.  Our community also has a mix of historic neighborhoods and increasingly high-density urban areas.nMore generally, my community of interest is the entire state of Arizona.  We are a ""purple"" state.  Our statewide officials demonstrate this - about half or Democrat and half are Republican.  In the last two presidential elections, we elected one Republican and one Democrat.  Our legislature reflects this - despite the fact that multiple current districts are not competitive for reasons other than VRA compliance:  the legislature is nearly equally split.  About a third of our registered voters identify as independent. 

The Commission should ensure that our districts reflect Arizona by making the districts as competitive as possible, while complying with the Voting Rights Act and protecting the voice of people of color, and while maximizing the implementation of the other criteria (i.e. comparable populations, compact/contiguous districts using boundaries or geographic features as lines)."
"I advocate for competitive districts across the state of Arizona to reflect the independence for which Arizonans are famous, ensure elected leaders can be held accountable for their actions and behaviors, and promote government action reflecting the needs of ever-changing times versus partisan dogma.  Arizona is a ""purple state"" and its districts should reflect the same.n"
"I live in the city of Tucson,  in the middle of Midtown in the Palo Verde neighborhood.  Almost half of my neighborhood is connected to the University of Arizona, either as employees or students. We have almost nothing in common with the communities to the north of River Road. We have shared issues with City Water, the City Council and Wards, TUSD, public transportation, student housing, homelessness, elevated crime and dense populations. 

The City of Tucson was split into two Congressional Districts during the last redistricting. I’m in CD 2, but only blocks from CD3, which includes the University of Arizona, which I walked to daily when I was working there. The City of Tucson needs to be represented by one Congressional District and not split into two so that our community interests can be represented as a whole. My neighborhood is far more impacted by what goes on with the UofA, Banner, 4th Avenue and Downtown than it is by Cochise County or even the east side of Tucson.n
The congressional district should be redrawn to keep the City of Tucson together to keep our community whole. The City of Tucson should be in one or two legislative districts, at least the heart of the city should be. There are enough issues in the City to deal with without compounding our district with the needs of communities that lay outside. 
The districts the previous commission drew were not compact and did not have equal population. There was too much focus on competitiveness. Please follow the Arizona Constitution when you are drawing districts this time so that this does not happen to us again."
"The SRPMIC has a long history in the Phoenix area.  Descendants of the SRPMIC, the Huhugam, thrived in the area since time immemorial and leave a considerable legacy today.  From agriculture to cultural resources throughout the valley, there are clear representations of the Pima and Maricopa people.  
Importantly, the SRPMIC was established by an Executive Order from President Rutherford B. Hayes on June 14, 1879.  This action created the Community that exists today on nearly 54,000 acres and a population of nearly 11,000.  Today, the SRPMIC has jurisdiction in all areas of the reservation.  From public safety and transportation, to education and environmental regulation the SRPMIC manage all affairs in its boundaries.  
The SRPMIC is also a partner in the East Valley.  As such, the SRPMIC work closely with cities, the County, and the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation on issues of common concern.
The SRPMIC is clearly a distinct and unique Community of Interest based on its history.nThe SRPMIC have five recommendations.  
• The SRPMIC is a distinct “community of interest” that is in one census tract.   As such, the SRPMIC recommend the AIRC keep the Community in a single Legislative and Congressional district.
•The SRPMIC share common borders with several large cities and share common issues.  As such, the SRPMIC recommend the AIRC place the Community in an urban Legislative and Congressional district, and not in any large rural district.
•The SRPMIC and the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation share a common border and many common issues.  The SRPMIC recommend the AIRC include the FMYN into the same Congressional district. 
•The SRPMIC share a common border with the City of Scottsdale.  The SRPMIC support being located in the same Congressional district.
•The SRPMIC share a border with the City of Tempe and the City of Mesa and share many common issues.  As such, the SRPMIC support being located in the same Legislative district, such as the current district #26"
"my community of interest is the mining ,ranching, farming, religious communities of long standing roots in graham and greenlee countiesnplease keep us out of the urban communities rather put us into the in the rural community maps. also keep the political balance between the parties within 4%."
"My COI is the quad cities which includes Prescott, where I live, Prescott Valley, Chino Valley and Dewey Humboldt.  This area is intersected by Highway 89, 89A and 69 so the cities of Mayer and Spring Valley are also impacted by this COI. This community is served by 3 colleges - Embrey Riddle, Prescott College and Yavapai College.   We also share the medical facilities of the Prescott VA, Dignity Health/Yavapai Regional Medical Center. Our recreational areas are off 89 and 69 as well as shopping.  We have a lively musical community with concerts on Whiskey Row and the Courthouse Square, where many other community activities take place.  The Quad Cities also share 3 museums, the Heritage Zoo and Highlands Nature Center, and the World's Oldest Rodeo takes place in Prescott.  We share a workforce and library system.  Also Prescott serves as county seat.nThank you for having the public listening tour.  I think that the communities of San Luis, Native Navajo Communities should also have listening tours.  The IRS should have their input.  
While I appreciate that you had a ONE DAY extension, the comments for COI should be extended until the map grids are released. 

Also the maps are difficult to navigate and create especially one a tablet or iPhone."
"My community of interest includes the city of Tucson, where I live, shop, and attend theatre productions. I have friends in the Catalina Foothills and Oro Valley and often shop there.  I attended high school in Oro Valley, lived with my parents in the near northwest side of town, outside the city limits, graduated from the U of A,  and lived for 30 years just north of River, outside the city boundaries. The foothills and Oro Valley are extensions of Tucson, having grown as the city grows.  Most people I know use city services and attend city functions and have many ties to the city.  Competitive districts are important to our democracy.  We live alongside people with differing viewpoints. Competitive districts keep politics vibrant and votes interested.  Representatives need to be aware of the differing perspectives in their communities, but should not have to also represent communities with little in common as a result of gerrymandering. Our IRC is a model.nPlease keep the new districts free from gerrymandering. Keep geographical areas intact so that representatives can adequately represent their constituents, even if the perspectives within the geographical area differ."
"I live on the border between the city and county.  I consider my community to be an open minded and progressive leaning area tied together by a sense of acceptance and tolerance and justice for all.  There is a diversity of race, class, culture, academics.  The people here are committed to rationality and reason, logic and fact.   We have a strong commitment to arts and science and culture and education.  I think the current district lines serve us rather well.  There is political diversity in the community and it is good that we don't have a dominance of one kind of political thought.  I love that my community seems to value preservation of the environment  and natural resources.  n"
"My family moved to Tucson recently and we've been getting to know the area by biking and trying new local restaurants. As a result, my thoughts on community are influenced by what is connected by bike paths and bus routes without interruption by major highways or geographical features. My idea of community is built on access: a network of businesses, residential areas, schools, and parks between which people can easily move and collaborate.nHealthy competition between ideas and perspectives on government makes our democracy stronger. I spent much of the past decade living in places where just one party had a lock on political positions at multiple levels. This provided little incentive as a citizen to participate in democracy because elections were effectively decided before they began. Within the dominate party, some seats had been held by one individual almost as long as I had lived. While those public servants had done great work, it was frustrating to not have real options for putting new voices and faces into the government because even primary elections were not competitive. I am a relatively new Arizona resident, but I am already encouraged by the independent redistricting commission's work. With my testimony, I simply want to encourage the IRC to keep the state's districts competitive to the extent possible given voting rights and compactness."

"Central Phoenix includes a series of neighborhoods connected by the light rail system and the strongest network of mass transit and density in Maricopa County. Large cultural events sites exist in this community and people living in this community often find themselves at the same events at the Fair Grounds, through historic home tours, along arts events and in the many different churches in the area. The land use particularly on the one-mile surrounding light rail is primarily residential and mixed-use, with more industrial services on the western outskirts which may be more malleable to other communities.nPlease maintain the Central Phoenix community in a solid district to the extent possible."
