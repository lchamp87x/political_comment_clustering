"Good morning,
My name is Brian Anthony Utz and I am a lifelong Arizona resident from the Verde Valley.
I’m attending this morning’s meeting with the intention to voice my concerns regarding the
potential use of Haystaq for Arizona’s redistricting process.
The fact that Haystaq has received blatantly favorable support from the Democratic Party,
former President Barack Obama, and presidential hopeful/Senator Bernie Sanders is
reason enough to warrant to concern of Arizona citizens in a time where election integrity
is of concern for the majority of Americans.
The use of Haystaq, an openly biased company, is an extremely inappropriate choice for
the state of Arizona, as Arizona is a state with a diverse political background that is home
to closely equal representation of both parties.
For this reason, I urge you to look beyond Haystaq as a candidate for redistricting needs.

Unfortunately, the NDC/Timmons Group has a record of disputed and rejected work in
various states around the country, including Arizona. Please consider the following cases:
In 2019, the West Contra Costa Unified School District (California) found that maps
produced by the NDC were in violation of the California Voting Rights Act and the US
Voting Rights Act.
In 2018-2019, the Redwood City Council (California) was forced to redraw maps produced
by NDC after they failed to create majority-minority maps for this city. This “error” cost the
city both time and cost.
In 2019, a North Carolina 3-judge panel found that NDC produced gerrymandered maps.
In 2018, Kern County won a court case that ruled that maps drawn by NDC violated the
Latino community’s ability to elect candidates of their choice.
And finally, during Arizona’s first IRC redistricting effort, maps drawn by NDC were
rejected by the courts for violating the Voting Rights Act and were ruled unconstitutional.
The record speaks for itself. I encourage you to reject NDC/Timmons Group.",no_NDC#other

nearly two decades of experience helping companies and campaigns accurately target
their communication and marketing.”
The company president, Andrew Drechsler, in his bio says, “His expertise has benefited

"To honor the provisions of the Arizona Constitution that govern redistricting, the IRC must
choose a mapping consultant that will fairly and equitably draw the required legislative
districts, in compliance with state and federal law.  A firm associated with Dr. Douglas
Johnson is not that consultant.
Numerous courts have rejected Dr. Johnson’s mapping results.  In a lengthy decision
discussing submissions by experts from both sides on the issue of whether North
Carolina's redistricting maps complied with state constitutional requirements, a three judge
panel emphatically rejected Dr. Johnson's testimony in support of the maps drawn to
advance partisan gerrymandering in that state.Common Cause v. Lewis, 834 S.E. 2d
425 (N. C. Sup. Ct. 2019) First, the Court noted that his testimony as an expert witness in
four redistricting cases in other courts had been rejected in all four cases.  Id. at .  One
case found his methodology ""inappropriate;"" Garrett v. City of Highland, 2016 WL
3693498, at * 2 ( Cal. Super. Apr. 6, 3016).  Another, Jauregui v. City of Palmdale, 2013
WL 7018375, at 2 (Cal. Super. Dec. 23, 2013), found  his work ""unsuitable"" and
""troubling"".  The North Carolina Court joined those other courts ""in rejecting Dr. Johnson’s
methodologies, analyses, and conclusions."" Common Cause v. Lewis.  Perhaps even
more significantly, the Court struck Johnson's testimony that supported the
gerrymandered maps and all related portions of his report about those maps when ""it was
uncovered on cross examination that Dr. Johnson made a series of significant errors.""  In
fact, the North Carolina Court found that Johnson created maps that ignored state
constitutional requirements.
The IRC has a duty to Arizonans to take measures to avoid unnecessary delays and
expense.  It would be a violation of that duty to hire a mapping consultant whose credibility
has been attacked in multiple cases and whose rejected work cost the taxpayers of those
jurisdictions hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Taylor English Decisions has no prior legislative mapping experience.
Instead, the IRC must hire a mapping firm with a proven track record of competence and
integrity in applying relevant election law to produce fair and lawful redistricting maps.
This will provide Arizona voters with confidence in the redistricting process as well as
timely results.  And it will also save taxpayer funds by eliminating the need to correct
rejected work. Haystaq DNA is such a firm and its predecessor firm provided excellent
guidance to the IRC in the past.",no_NDC#no_taylor_english#yes_haystaq

have shared data with the Trump campaign. That's fine, that's their prerogative for sure.
However, that doesn't mean they should be used in an independent process.
It is entirely possible that they could be objective and even recommend a map that goes
against their political interest. I would be skeptical since their biases and preferences
could manifest in subtle ways, especially if such mapping is done algorithmically in a
proprietary manner. At the very least, you should consider their background as a
significant hurdle in the selection process.
If they are chosen, I want transparency as to why they were selected over their

failed map making, drawing maps that did not comply with state and federal constitutional
requirements.  Those failures cost the taxpayers of the relevant political jurisdictions tens
of thousands of dollars, payment for failed work.  For these reasons,  Timmons

of the U.S. and Arizona Constitutions, and with the difficulties of drawing maps in a state
with huge differences between densely packed urban areas and remote rural ones.

"As mentioned in this morning's meeting, yes, it is true that there is no perfect mapping
consultant. However, I strongly urge the Independent Redistricting Commission to reject
NDC and Timmons Group for several important reasons.
First and foremost, NDC was selected as mapping consultant for the 2001 Arizona IRC,
and their first two maps approved were thrown out due to unconstitutionality. Selecting a
consultant with this terrible track record would by nature erode public trust in the integrity
of the IRC.
Further, it is clear that NDC, Timmons Group, and Doug Johnson have not learned from
these mistakes. Most recently, in 2019 the West Contra Costa Unified School District
(WCCUSD) settled a civil rights lawsuit which claimed that the district's at-large election
map ""dilutes the voting strength of Latino and African American citizens."" NDC cost the
district over $650,000 to produce this map, and their map was l kely in violation of both the
California Voting Rights Act (CVRA) and Section 2 of the US Voting Rights Act. Ultimately
the court ruled against NDC, wasting valuable time and taxpayer funds.
Also in 2019, North Carolina’s landmark gerrymandering case Common Cause v Lewis
resulted in a three-judge panel tossing out Doug Johnson’s testimony in defense of North
Carolina’s gerrymandered map. Perhaps most egregious, Doug Johnson later admitted
his own testimony was incorrect.
In sum, there is no conscionable way the IRC can select NDC as mapping consultant.
NDC has a failed history of unconstitutionality here in Arizona, and they have much more
recent history of discriminatory mapmaking across the US. I urge the IRC to remain
independent, continue to work for the public's trust, and reject NDC and Timmons Group
from consideration. Thank you.",no_NDC#other

"On behalf of the Committee for Independence and Diversity, I express great concern over
demographer Doug Johnson of National Demographics Corporation (NDC) and related
multiple lawsuits over racial gerrymandering and violations of Latinos’ voting rights.
In 2019, NDC was subject of a racial gerrymandering lawsuit in North Carolina. Mr.
Johnson was accused of lying about numbers on maps, calling into question the credibility
and competency of him and the firm. His “Expert Testimony” was thrown out by a three-
judge panel, saying NDC’s data was found to be inadequate and unreliable. One judge
wrote: “The Court finds Dr. Johnson’s analysis unpersuasive and gives his opinions little
weight. Dr. Johnson has testified as a live expert witness in four cases previously, and the
courts in all four cases have rejected his analysis.”
https://bit.ly/3dX20qc
Also see https://bit.ly/2PqZz5x
Earlier, in 2018, a US District Court Judge ruled that Mr. Johnson's redistricting denied
Latinos the ability to elect candidates of their choice and violated the federal Voting Rights
Act.  Even earlier: In 2011, in Yuma County, NDC failed to meet deadlines to provide draft
maps.  The commissioners rejected the maps citing that they did not want to approve a
map submitted that same day.  https://stevemuratore.blogspot.com/2011/06/redistricting-
potential-mapping.html.
Mr. Johnson and NDC may claim to have experience in Arizona’s redistricting process,
just because they produced maps for the 2001 to the AZIRC – but their maps did not hold
up in court.  In fact, their maps did not receive preclearance from the Department of
Justice. The following excerpt is from the January 2004 Ruling by the Superior Court of
Arizona: “On May 20, 2002, during the federal court proceedings, the DOJ objected to the
Commission’s 2001 Adopted Legislative Plan as having a retrogressive effect on Hispanic
voting strength in at least three of five legislative districts (13, 14, 15, 23, and 29). Ex.
4123. In explaining its refusal to preclear District 23, the DOJ cited the Commission’s
removal of San Manuel and Oracle from District 23. Id. at 4. The DOJ reserved its
harshest language for the Commission’s treatment of District 23 when it said that “the
removal of these two towns [San Manuel and Oracle] and the resulting drop in the
Hispanic voting age population percentage, has raised concerns regarding the ability of
the AIRC to establish that this action, which had a retrogressive effect, may have also
been taken, at least in part, with a retrogressive intent.” Id. at 5.”
The selection of Mr. Johnson and NDC would be detrimental to Latino voters hoping to
have an equal voice in an equal vote. Mr. Johnson’s track record has demonstrated that
he will not protect the voting rights of Latinos and communities of interest. We fear that
selecting Mr. Johnson and NDC will only serve to violate our voting rights.

attending many meetings and making comments.  We had a resident of Payson who was
proposing maps with all the required content of number of citizens, number of voters of
different registrations, ages, ethnicities, similar precincts, rural vs urban boundaries, etc.
He did a great job of mapping with the proper number of voters in each of the several

in AZ.  We do not need an outside mapping contractor who is not familiar with Arizona to
do mapping.  Especially one with ties to people already tied to election fraud.
When I went to a IRC meeting in Flagstaff in 2011, I was secretly given a 8-12 page folder
and was told not to let anyone else see me looking at it.  It was a Democrat guide for
activists to push the agenda to turn AZ Blue like they did with the redistricting in Colorado
after the 2000 election.  It asked activists to basically turn the Redistricting requirements
for the priorities of of values upside down and force the issue that communities of political
interest should be the priority trying to get as many minority and very competitive districts
as possible rather than following the Redistricting prescribed order of values.  This caused
huge gerrymandered legislative and Congressional districts, splitting up communities,
counties, and other egregious tearing apart of communities of interest.
The Civil Rights Attorney who was working the 2011 Redistricting fought with us to compel
us to split up our rural county and he won.
This Year's Redistricting Commission should work to follow the real priority rules of
Redistricting and not let out of state money and out of state Mapping companies further
divide communities of interest.  It should not gerrymander districts with half a district on
one side of a mountain and half on the other side.

legislative districts, and slant them to the Democratic Party.  This year, they are trying
again to slant things toward the Democrats by trying to hire HAYSTAQdna to re-draw our
districts.  HAYSTAQdna was used by both Barak Obama and Bernie Sanders in their
campaigns.  This is right on HAYSTAQdna.com webpage.  Please block the unfair use of

Some thoughts on the PI position:  Again, please select the most qualified and
experienced talent possible to get a serious jump start on organizing means and methods
for public input. These folks need to have a firm grasp on arranging/hosting public
meetings, as well as radio, TV, and social media outreach.  How well that public input is
gathered and shared with the entire IRC team will be key.  Giving the public transparency
and access to info will help build the trust that is vital.
There is way too much exec session.  What if you held discussion in public and saved the
Qs and attorney advice comments for a followup exec session?  I have not yet found the
actual meeting minutes, only the YouTube link for previous meetings. The public is not
getting a very full picture of the IRC discourse.
Regarding the ""speakers bureau"" of Commissioners, may I suggest that focus be given to
civic and educational audiences more so that political ones?  LD political groups will
already know and understand a great deal about the decennial census and redistricting.
You can spend your limited time and resources better by speaking to Rotary, Kiwanis,
Lions, Chambers of Commerce, college classrooms, AAUW, LWV and the like. There will
be much overlap and diversity in these groups, and you will be able to catch
Independents, along with Rs and Ds (and maybe some not-yet-registereds).  Make your

them minimized.

·In 2008, HaystaqDNA was the chief data modeling firm for the president campaign of
Barack Obama, who, in conjunction with Eric Holder, one of his attorneys general, is
actively involved in influencing redistricting efforts in Arizona.
·In 2014, HaystaqDNA was hired by Americans for Responsible Solutions, a gun

Senator Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) — to “spearhead its data and modeling efforts” promoting
Democrats.
·In 2018, HaystaqDNA co-founder Michael Simon donated to the campaign of
Senator Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.)
·In 2019, HaystaqDNA chief executive officer Ken Strasma donated to the campaign
of Senator Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.).
·HaystaqDNA’s clients include at least three political groups — Need to Impeach,
NexGen Climate America, and For Our Future — primarily backed by Democratic mega-
donor Tom Steyer, who has spent millions of attempting to give Democrats control over

2004 that NDC had received and used the locations of all of the legislative and

Arizona Constitution. See paragraph 109 of Judge Field's January 16, 2004 order. Based

whatsoever. It is the right of Arizonans to live in a state which has been fairly mapped. The
mapping of our state should not benefit one party over the other, and the districts should
comply with the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act. Again, as an Arizonan, I ask
you to NOT hire a company with partisan conflicts of interest. Thank you for your time.

working with the IRC in ANY type of way, as a vendor or otherwise.
Due to the fact that this firm was started by former Obama staffers and has been
controlled by Democrats, as well as the fact that they have worked extensively with Bernie
Sanders and other Democrat politicians, it seems to me that this firm will be too partisan
and will not be able to be truly independent.

all voters, regardless of party or ideology, can trust the fairness of our new maps.

"Hello my name is Sam, and as a freedom loving citizen of Arizona, I am concerned about
one of the mapping companies being considered to be selected to re-map Arizona's
districts in the near future. This company is Haystaq DNA, previously known as Strategic
Telemetry, and they have openly advertised in their websites and advertisement campaign
to ""helping to level the playing field by providing individual-level micro-targeting, data
analysis, strategic consulting and other services for Democratic candidates and
progressive organizations"". In advertising their services, they stated, ""It's about time our
side [the political left] had a secret weapon!"".
I am completely convinced that ""the secret weapon"" was to manipulate the remapping in
any way they could find to benefit the Democratic Party and their progressive agenda,
because shortly after their unfair re-mapping the very consistent representative selection
of the Arizonian People changed in favor of the Democratic Party.
I consider myself a libertarian, pretty non-partisan, and I am convinced its not a good idea
to select any company that does not follow FAIR and HONEST mapping rules laid out by
your organization which are 1) Comply with the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights
ACT 2) Be of Equal population 3) Be compact and contiguous 4) Respect communities of
interest 5) Use visible geographic features, city town,, and county boundaries, and
undivided Census tracts 6) Be competitive when not a significant detriment to other goals.
Haystaq DNA in their own words and actions, do not represent a company that is capable
of being non-partisan and would undoubtedly tweak the mapping to benefit their political
agenda. I strongly suggest this company to be scrubbed off the table and not be ever
considered to re-map Arizona. The honest and fair Arizonian People deserve a company
that will not act against their interests.

made putting all this into consideration.

'clarifying' points made by the firms.  Not only will the public be unable to see what the
firms have said in response to us, we will also not have an opportunity to hold them to the
truth.  They could simply say that all of the objections raised by the pubic are false or they
could cite some already-debunked articles, statements, or positions that appear on the

"IRC Commissioners,
I am writing to emphatically ask that you not hire Timmons Group, which in realty is driven
by National Demographics Corporation (NDC). NDC and their President, Doug Johnson,
have a history of under-representing Latinos in election mapping.
First, NDC drew county districts in Kern County, California, that under-represented
Latinos.  The Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund sued Kern County
over their draft maps because in those proposed districts Latinos would be unable to elect
a person of their choosing to represent them in the county. NDC President Doug Johnson
submitted unabashed testimony defending these obvious gerrymandered maps. Though it
was clear that the proposed maps were legally unacceptable, he forged ahead in order to
preserve his own political agenda. The U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the redistricting
plan unlawfully denied Latinos the ability to elect candidates of their choice. This type of
conduct should not be acceptable to any map-drawing body that is charged with ensuring
fair and equal representation.
Similarly, in Redwood City, California, NDC was also accused of gerrymandering when
they failed to create a second Latino-majority city district.  The uproar from community
advocates about the obvious inequity compelled NDC to reverse their biased map-drawing
and created second Latino-majority district. This about-face occurred after NDC’s first set
of proposed maps were adopted. It forced the City Council to restart the process that led
to the second district.
These two examples should be concerning to all of you because Latino representation is
critical to ensuring equitable elections in Arizona. It is clear that in NDC’s prior mapping
contracts they failed to protect the voting influence of communities of color. These cases
demonstrate the callous political disenfranchisement of communities. Clearly, hiring NDC
would not be in the best interests of the state of Arizona. The Commission should certainly
be concerned - not only of preventing costly lawsuits, but also of the importance of
protecting voting rights for all Arizona communities.
Sincerely,
Daniel R. Ortega, Jr.
